#   RUNSIM    the test replica. It starts SIBLING containers through the
#             mounted socket, so it needs that plus the replica's own knobs.
#   RUNBUILD  `make build`, which needs both: the payload is assembled inside
#             the replica, and the output has to belong to you. Defined below
#             the two it borrows from.
#
# Test-only variables never enter a build, which is the point of the split.
#
# THE SIGNING KEY HAS TO BE MOUNTED, and this is the only place that can do
# it. config.env names the key and is read INSIDE the container, so make never
# sees the path unless it reads it here -- and the key deliberately lives
# outside the checkout (it must never be committable), which means the only
# mount that would have covered it is the one for this repo. Without this,
# `make packages` with a key at the documented ~/.anvil/anvil.rsa reports that
# the file does not exist, on a machine where it plainly does.
#
# Read from the config file only when the environment does not already say,
# so `APK_SIGN_KEY=... make packages` still works for a one-off -- and from

#  THE qa SUITE
#
#  Same machine, same gates, one framework. `make qa` is the suite; see
#  qa/conftest.py for the lanes.
#
#    make qa           both lanes
#    make qa-static    needs nothing: parses, bashisms, names, the probes
#    make qa-replica   needs docker + the firmware
#
#  There is no strictness flag and there is nothing to remember to pass. A
#  missing tool, daemon, replica image or package FAILS, at the point that
#  needs it, with the fix in the message. Skips are reserved for a question
#  that does not apply to this configuration, and there are currently none.
#
#  The replica lane needs two things, and says so if either is absent:
#
#    a base replica   PRINTER_IMAGE in test.env (see test.env.example)
#    a package        work/out/*.tgz, from `make build`
#
#  There is ONE way to get a replica, and it is that image. `make rootfs`
#  used to be a second: it unsquashed rootfs.squashfs out of the stock
#  package into work/rootfs and a thin container bind-mounted it. Every
#  caller set PRINTER_IMAGE anyway -- CI included, which extracted a rootfs
#  on every push and read none of it -- and `make printer-image` builds the
#  image from the same public firmware without needing a stock package at
#  all, so the fallback was a second path to the same place that nothing
#  took. Rebuild the image when it goes stale; that is the one lever.
#
#  It needs the package because it INSTALLS it, through the printer's own
#  app_startup.sh off a real FAT stick, rather than hand-placing payload/.
#  That way the install is under test too, and the payload under test is the
#  built artefact -- s6 and CPython included, neither of which exists in
#  payload/. Baked into an image once per package and cached on its md5.
