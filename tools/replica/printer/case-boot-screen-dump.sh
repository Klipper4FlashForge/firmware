# Render every first-boot screen inside the replica and print each one as a
# base64 PNG on stdout.
#
# This is the answer to "I want to SEE it, not read assertions about it". The
# frames are drawn by $MODDIR/bin/python3.13 -- our own cross-built CPython,
# the interpreter FF_PYTHON names, running MIPS under qemu against the
# printer's real rootfs -- so what comes out is what the panel would show, not
# what a developer's interpreter thinks it would.
#
# stdout is the only way out: every mount the replica gets is read-only. The
# frames are PNG-compressed in here (zlib is stdlib) rather than shipped raw,
# because a 1024x600x32 frame is 2.4MB and there are several of them.
#
# tools/replica/sim-boot-screen.py drives this and writes the PNGs out.
