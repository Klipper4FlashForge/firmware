# ONE image covers both models, because there is genuinely nothing
# model-specific to put in a second one: rootfs.squashfs is byte-for-byte
# identical in both packages, and /usr/prog comes from the factory image, only
# the Pro's of which was ever published. The model is decided by whichever
# stock package a test installs, which overwrites app_startup.sh, firmwareExe,
# start.sh, klipper, passwd and shadow with that model's genuine files.
#
# The Dockerfile downloads the firmware itself, so nothing has to be staged
# locally and the build context is just tools/replica/printer. Override with
# STOCK_URL= FACTORY_URL= FW_VERSION=.
#
# The image carries the real rootfs and the real /usr/prog and /usr/data,
# pre-unpacked into /parts, and the STOCK PACKAGE ALREADY INSTALLED -- done
# here once rather than at the start of every replica run, where it costs 37
# seconds of qemu. It cannot be a `docker build` step, because it needs
# binfmt_misc and chroot and therefore --privileged, so the build runs it in a
# container and commits the result. The md5 is recorded in /usr/prog/.BASELINE
# and entrypoint.sh reinstalls if a run asks for a different one.
#
# THE IMAGE CONTAINS PROPRIETARY FLASHFORGE FIRMWARE. Pushing it redistributes
# their software.
