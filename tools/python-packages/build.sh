# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Cross-build the third-party Python packages Moonraker and klippy import, for
# the CPython 3.13 that tools/python/build.sh produces (Ingenic mipsel).
#
# SPIKE. Nothing here is wired into bin/payload.sh yet.
#
# Same non-negotiables as tools/python/build.sh:
#   * e_flags 0x70001405 for an EXEC, 0x70001407 for a DYN. Every .so is
#     gated; a legacy-NaN wheel imports fine on the host and fails on the
#     printer with nothing but ENOEXEC.
#   * -EL -mnan=2008 must reach the COMPILE and the LINK of every object.
#     setuptools does not forward CFLAGS to its link line, so the flags are
#     baked into PATH wrappers around the gcc driver.
#   * glibc toolchain only -- klippy dlopens a glibc c_helper.so.
#
# THE CROSS TRICK, with no crossenv: the staged interpreter carries
# _sysconfigdata__linux_mipsel-linux-gnu.py, recording the cross CC, LDSHARED,
# EXT_SUFFIX and INCLUDEPY, and _PYTHON_SYSCONFIGDATA_NAME pointed at it from
# an x86-64 CPython of the SAME version makes setuptools' build_ext answer for
# the TARGET. The staged tree is bind-mounted at its real prefix so INCLUDEPY
# resolves without rewriting anything.
#
# Usage:
#     ./build-pyext.sh              # in docker
#     ./build-pyext.sh --in-container
