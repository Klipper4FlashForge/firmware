# How it works

## Reusing FlashForge's own updater

We reuse FlashForge's updater rather than writing a parallel one. The stock
chain, recovered from `app_startup.sh`, the `unTar` binary and the rootfs
image:

```
busybox init → /etc/init.d/rcS → S99factory_test_shell
             → /usr/prog/app_startup.sh
                 ├─ mounts /dev/sda* on /mnt, globs Creator5Pro-*.tgz
                 ├─ /usr/prog/bin/unTar  (des3 decrypt → /usr/data/update)
                 └─ runFirmwareExe.sh Creator5Pro 0029   ← OURS
                        ├─ gates: architecture, model/PID
                        ├─ per component: extract → md5 gate → run.sh
                        └─ the mod: payload, symlinks, configs, password
             → firmwareExe  ← the UI, and what starts Klipper
```

The mod meets the stock printer in exactly **two files**, and owns both:

* `runFirmwareExe.sh`, the installer. `app_startup.sh` runs whatever it finds
  under that name in the package it just decrypted, so owning the name is all
  it takes to own the install. Ours is `installer/runFirmwareExe.sh`;
  `bin/pack.sh` bakes the model gate and the password mode into it.
* `/usr/prog/PROGRAM/software/firmwareExe`, the UI binary, replaced by a shell
  script that starts the supervisor.

Because everything funnels through those two, `app_startup.sh`, `rcS` and the
whole init chain stay **completely stock and unpatched**.

A release ships **no FlashForge component at all** — just the installer and the
payload — so nothing it does touches `/usr/prog/PROGRAM/software` except the
one symlink. Two things follow, and both are why it is worth doing:

* `app_startup.sh`'s watchdog greps `ps` for `firmwareExe` five seconds after
  launch. The wrapper *is* `firmwareExe` and stays in the foreground, so the
  stock watchdog supervises the mod correctly.
* When nothing by that name is running, the same watchdog copies one out of the
  version directory, `/usr/prog/PROGRAM/software/<version>/firmwareExe`. That
  directory is still FlashForge's, with their genuine binary in it, so a
  printer whose payload failed to install comes up on the stock UI instead of a
  blank screen. A release that shipped its own component would have replaced
  that directory and taken the recovery with it.

Flashing the stock FlashForge package is still the uninstall.

## Services

Services are **s6-rc services**, defined in `payload/etc/s6-rc/source/`,
compiled into a database at build time and supervised by `s6-svscan`:

```
mcu-bringup  oneshot   toolhead boards out of their bootloaders
klipper      longrun   klippy            (depends on mcu-bringup)
wifi         longrun   wpa_supplicant on wlan0
wifi-dhcp    longrun   udhcpc, on wpa_supplicant's association
                       events                      (depends on wifi)
nginx        longrun   nginx (Mainsail on :80 and Fluidd on :81)
moonraker    longrun   moonraker on :7125
camera       longrun   mjpg-streamer on :8080 (nginx proxies it at /webcam/)
ntp          longrun   sntpd, the clock (there is no RTC and no battery)
run-scripts  oneshot   user *.sh files, with a 30-second boot deadline
ff-startup   oneshot   waits until the printer is usable
                       (depends on klipper, moonraker)
ui           longrun   HelixScreen       (depends on ff-startup)
ok-all       bundle    everything except mcu-bringup, which klipper pulls in
```

`firmwareExe` starts `s6-svscan`, runs `s6-rc-init`, and asks for one machine
state — that transition is the whole boot order. There is no `init.d/`
directory and no wrapper scripts: **s6-rc is the command line**.

```sh
s6-rc -u change moonraker           # start it (and its dependencies)
s6-rc -d change moonraker           # stop it (and whatever depends on it)
s6-svc -r /usr/data/anvil/etc/s6/moonraker    # restart, leaving s6-rc's view intact
s6-svstat /usr/data/anvil/etc/s6/moonraker    # is it up, and for how long
s6-rc -a list                       # what s6-rc believes is up
```

Two things are worth knowing before you type them. `-d change` follows
dependencies, so stopping moonraker also stops `ff-startup` and therefore the
screen — that is correct, there is nothing for a printer UI to show, and
`-u change` brings them back. And `moonraker` and `camera` are the only
services with a `notification-fd`, so only their "up" means *usable* rather
than *forked*; `klipper`'s does not, because klippy's readiness is a state on
moonraker's API rather than something klippy reports.

nginx is deliberately **not** a dependency of moonraker even though it proxies
it: an edge would mean stopping nginx also stopped the API, which is the thing
splitting the old single `S60web` script in two was meant to prevent.

One sourced library sits beside them, installed to `/usr/data/anvil` and not
executable:

* **`anvil-env.sh`** — `PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `FF_PYTHON`, in the one
  place that defines them. `runFirmwareExe.sh`, `firmwareExe`, `start.sh` and every
  service script source it. A private copy per script is how the installer's
  check and the boot script came to disagree about the library list, with
  moonraker dying on `libpython3.8.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file`.

Everything the mod installs lives under `/usr/data/anvil` on the **data**
partition, which a FlashForge OTA cannot delete. Nothing at all is installed to
`/usr/prog`: it is the firmware partition, it keeps only one version of a
component (the installer wipes every other version directory), and it could not
fit ~100MB of web UI in any case.

## Moonraker

The mod ships its own Moonraker (pinned in `versions.env`) and runs it from
`/usr/data/anvil/moonraker/moonraker.py`. FlashForge's is a 2022 build that reports API 1.0.5, old enough
that the current Mainsail hides features it cannot see. The visible one is the
camera: Moonraker only grew the webcam `enabled` flag in April 2023, Mainsail
filters its webcam list on exactly that field, and so every `[webcam]` entry is
discarded and the panel disappears — while the stream itself is perfectly
healthy behind nginx. No config change can fix that from either side.

**It is installed by being extracted.** The tree rides in the mod payload, the
payload unpacks to `/usr/data/anvil`, and that is the whole installation —
there is no separate Moonraker step that can fail on its own. Nothing is
written to `/usr/prog`: FlashForge's tree at `/usr/prog/moonraker/moonraker/`
is left exactly where it is and simply never used again, and
the moonraker service starts ours by absolute path with no fallback.

An earlier release copied the same tree over `/usr/prog/moonraker` as well.
That is gone. It put a second, byte-identical Moonraker on the one partition
with no room to spare — the only step of the install that could fail on disk
space, failing as "no working web UI" — and because `/usr/prog` is what a stock
FlashForge flash overwrites while `/usr/data/anvil` survives one, it made
"which Moonraker is this printer running?" depend on what was flashed last.
Both things thought to require that location turned out not to: the
`moonraker-env` virtualenv beside it was never on `sys.path` (checked by
running the printer's own interpreter against the real image), and
`moonrakerDaemon`, the one thing that did exec that tree by absolute path, is
never invoked — the moonraker service starts the server itself.

**FlashForge's python 3.8.2 is not what this runs on any more.** `FF_PYTHON`
in `anvil-env.sh` names a CPython 3.13 of our own, cross-built for mipsel by
`pkgs/3rdparty/python`, with every third-party C extension Moonraker needs beside it in
`$MODDIR/lib/python3.13/site-packages` — nineteen packages, one `pkgs/3rdparty/python-*`
recipe and one `.apk` each — and libsodium in `$MODDIR/lib`; none of it
borrowed from `/usr/prog`. Measured through the
real boot path (the scandir, the moonraker service, readiness gating on `:7125`
actually listening, a `kill -9` respawn, a stop that stays stopped). klippy is on it
too: the `klipper` service execs `$FF_PYTHON` against the klippy tree in
`$MODDIR/klipper`, so both halves are ours.

**Moonraker is a release now, `v0.11.0`, and no longer a 2023 commit.**
FlashForge built python 3.8.2 without the `_sqlite3` module, and Moonraker
moved its database from lmdb to sqlite in v0.9.0, so on 3.8.2 every release
from there on got as far as loading the database component and died with
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_sqlite3'`. Our 3.13 has a working
`_sqlite3` (measured: create, insert, select, reopen -- and exercised for real
every run, since Moonraker itself comes up on it in `qa/replica/test_web.py`),
which is what unpinned it.

Upgrading a printer that has run an older release **converts** its database:
Moonraker reads the existing `data.mdb` once and writes an sqlite store beside
it, which is why `anvil-python-lmdb` still ships even though nothing imports
lmdb at runtime any more. Without that module Moonraker tries to `pip install`
one, and a printer has no index to install from -- the old database would be
dropped in silence. Reverting to stock is still a clean round trip: the lmdb
store is read, not deleted.

The dependency set moved with it. `dbus-next` became `dbus-fast`,
`importlib-metadata` (and its `zipp`) is new, and `pyserial-asyncio` is gone,
imported by nothing in 0.11.0.

This was not worked out in advance; v0.9.3 was built, shipped and tried on the
printer first, and that is what it said. What came out of it: when bumping the
pin, the blocker to check is native modules, not the python version.

There is nothing left for the installer to do about Moonraker. An earlier
release copied the tree over `/usr/prog/moonraker`, and needed a preflight
import check and a move-aside-and-roll-back dance because that copy could fail
on a full firmware partition and leave the printer with no web UI. Both are
gone with the copy: the payload extracts to `/usr/data/anvil` and that *is* the
installation, so there is no separate Moonraker step that can fail on its own.

`make test` covers this end to end on the printer replica: that the swap
happened, that the installed `webcam.py` has the `enabled` field, that the
shipped tree runs on our own CPython 3.13 (`$FF_PYTHON`) **and is still running
after a settle**, and that its log has no import errors. The settle matters — a
build that dies on a missing module is alive for a second or two first, and
checking only "did it start" is what let the sqlite3 failure through.
`BUILD_MOONRAKER=0` builds a package that leaves the stock server alone.

## Five things the stock firmware does that will surprise you

Each of these silently breaks a package or a printer, and each is enforced by
a check in `make test`:

| | Reality |
|---|---|
| **`*.tar.xz` is not xz** | The components are plain tar archives carrying an `.xz` name. The installer runs a bare `tar -xvf`, so a genuinely xz-compressed file does not install. |
| **`.tgz` is not gzip** | DES3-encrypted plain tar. The key is hardcoded in the printer's own `unTar` binary. Modern OpenSSL needs `-md md5` to match its OpenSSL 1.0.2. |
| **Nothing in init starts Klipper** | `firmwareExe` runs `/usr/prog/klipper/start.sh`. Replace the UI without accounting for this and the printer boots to a working screen that cannot move or heat. |
| **The installer wipes the software dir first** | `ls \| grep -v temp \| xargs rm -rf` runs *before* `run.sh`, so the previous `firmwareExe` is already gone. Uninstalling means flashing the stock package, which still **ships** the genuine binary; nothing can back one up. |
| **Binaries must be nan2008** | The Ingenic X2000 kernel returns `ENOEXEC` for legacy-NaN MIPS. Debian's `gcc-mipsel-linux-gnu` cannot produce a usable binary — its libc is legacy-NaN. |

**And one pleasant surprise, found by unpacking `rootfs.squashfs` out of the
kernel component:** ssh needs no work at all. The stock rootfs already ships
`/usr/sbin/dropbear` and an enabled `/etc/init.d/S50dropbear`, so port 22 is
*already open* on a stock printer. There is simply no published root password.
Setting `ROOT_PW_HASH` is the whole feature.

## Two models, two packages

Creator 5 and Creator 5 Pro are **not interchangeable**. Each stock package
carries a `MACHINE=`/`PID=` gate that refuses to install on the other model,
and — the part that actually matters — they ship **different `firmwareExe`
binaries**. A package built for one model would hand the other the wrong
firmware, so each must be built from its own stock package.

| Model | MACHINE | PID | USB filename the printer looks for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Creator 5 | `Creator5` | `0028` | `/mnt/Creator5-*.tgz` |
| Creator 5 Pro | `Creator5Pro` | `0029` | `/mnt/Creator5Pro-*.tgz` |

The filename prefix and the gate inside must agree: `app_startup.sh` globs for
the prefix, and `runFirmwareExe.sh` checks the gate. A mismatch means the
printer picks the file up and then refuses it. Nothing on the build host
checks the pair any more: `make qa-replica` installs the package the way the
printer does, off a real FAT filesystem through `app_startup.sh`, so a
mismatch stops the install there rather than being predicted beforehand.

## Recovery

Recovery is the stock FlashForge package for your model. Flashing it restores
the files the mod replaced out of that package; the payload under
`/usr/data/anvil` survives but is inert. `make test-recovery` used to do exactly
that inside the replica -- comparing `firmwareExe`, `app_startup.sh` and
`klipper/start.sh` byte for byte and checking that nothing stock still
referenced the leftovers -- but that gate has been retired without a
replacement; see [qa-migration.md](qa-migration.md).

One thing it does not cover, worth knowing before you rely on it:

* **Moonraker.** The mod's Moonraker lives on the data partition at
  `/usr/data/anvil/moonraker`, and it is started by
  the mod's own moonraker service — which a stock flash removes along
  with the rest of the mod's boot path. So a stock reflash goes back to
  FlashForge's own 2022 tree at `/usr/prog/moonraker/moonraker/`, which was
  never touched and is still exactly what the factory image shipped. The mod's
  copy is left behind on `/usr/data` and is inert: nothing stock knows the path.

  This used to be a caveat in the other direction. An earlier release installed
  its Moonraker over `/usr/prog/moonraker`, keeping the stock tree beside it as
  `moonraker.modold` and deleting that once the copy succeeded — so a stock
  reflash silently kept running the mod's build, and losing power mid-swap left
  the printer with no Moonraker at all and needed a hand-run `mv` over ssh to
  put the `.modold` tree back. Neither the `.modold` path nor the recovery
  instruction exists any more. If Moonraker is missing or broken now, the fix
  is to reflash the mod package: it carries the whole tree, and extracting the
  payload is the entire installation.
