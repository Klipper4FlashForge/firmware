# Versions

What a package contains, and what each piece is pinned at. Every one of these
is fixed at build time: a release is a fixed set of these versions, not
whatever was current when it was built.

How the pieces fit together on the printer — which of them is a service, what
starts what, and what stays stock — is [How it works](how-it-works.md).
