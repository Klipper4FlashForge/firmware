# Packaging: apk vs opkg, and the migration between them

Whether to stop hand-building Python, Moonraker, s6 and libsodium into one
tarball and start building *packages* instead. Written 2026-08-28, and the
answer was opkg; revisited 2026-08-31 and reversed, because two lines of the
comparison turned out to be wrong. **The feed is apk now.** The comparison is
kept as written, because a decision is only reviewable next to what it was
made on -- read the Decision section under it before leaning on the table.

Same rules as `80-s6-migration.md`: each phase is independently shippable and
names the gate that proves it.

## Why, in one paragraph

`bin/patch.sh` was 1,900 lines and eleven cross-builds deep, and its output was a
single 53MB `anvil.tar.xz` that the printer's installer unpacks whole. Changing
one line of `anvil.conf` ships all 53MB. There is no way to install just a new
Moonraker onto a printer you are debugging, no record on the machine of what
version of anything is on it, and the "remove what the last release installed"
problem has already been solved once by hand — `installer/run-append.sh` reads an
install manifest and prunes by it, which is a package manager's file database
with one package in it. The question is whether to keep growing that or to
adopt the format that already means it.

## The fact that decides the comparison

**Neither package manager brings any software with it.** This is the whole
argument and it is worth stating before the table, because every "apk vs opkg"
discussion elsewhere on the internet is really about which distro's *repository*
you want, and neither repository can be used here:

* **Alpine has no MIPS port at all.** Not "an old one" or "a community one" —
  mips is not among the architectures Alpine builds. There is no `apk` repo to
  point at.
* **OpenWrt does have `mipsel_24kc`**, which is the same ISA and the same o32
  ABI as this printer — and is built against **musl**. This printer's rootfs is
  glibc 2.29, and the reason that matters is written down at length in
  `versions.env`: klippy's `c_helper.so` is dlopened by a glibc interpreter, so
  glibc is not a preference here. An OpenWrt package would unpack perfectly and
  produce a library nothing can load.

So every package will be cross-built by this repo either way. A package manager
buys **packaging, versioning and installation**. It does not buy software, and
adopting one does not make `bin/patch.sh`'s cross-builds go away — it
reorganises them into units with names and versions.

That reframes the choice entirely: the winner is whichever format is cheapest
to *produce* and *install* on a machine we control, not whichever has the
better ecosystem.

## The comparison

|                                | **opkg / .ipk**                                                                 | **apk / .apk (Alpine)**                                       |

| Making a package               | `ar` + two `tar.gz` + a 3-byte version file                                     | three concatenated gzip streams with an RSA signature over the control stream |
| ...and the tool that does it   | **`opkg-build`, upstream, 423 lines of POSIX sh**                               | realistically `abuild` + `abuild-sign` + a keypair, and `abuild` assumes an Alpine host |
| Indexing a feed                | `opkg-make-index`, from the same upstream                                       | `apk index`, needs the signing key                             |
| Cross-building the packages    | irrelevant; we stage a tree and hand it over                                    | same, if you hand-roll; painful through `abuild`               |
| On-device client               | `opkg` + **libarchive** + zlib                                                  | `apk-tools` + zlib + **openssl**                               |
| ...and what we already build   | libarchive: nothing. New cross-build.                                            | openssl 3.0.15 and zlib **are already cross-built** for CPython |
| Offline install into a prefix  | `--offline-root DIR`, and `opkg install ./file.ipk` needs no feed at all         | `apk add --root DIR --allow-untrusted ./file.apk`              |
| Signing                        | optional; signs the **index**, so packages need no signature each                | expected; `--allow-untrusted` to skip                          |
| Format stability               | unchanged for over a decade; also Yocto/OpenEmbedded's native format             | apk-tools 3 introduced a new package format; v2/v3 coexistence is live churn |
| Home turf                      | embedded MIPS with a read-only rootfs — exactly this device class                | a full musl distro root                                        |

Two honest points for apk, since it is the more actively developed tool: its
`world` model (a declarative "these are the packages I want", reconciled on
every operation) is genuinely nicer than opkg's imperative install/remove, and
**its runtime dependencies are ones this repo already cross-builds** while
opkg's libarchive is not. If the deciding factor were the on-device client,
apk would win.

It is not. The deciding factor is that every package has to be produced here,
by us, on every build, in CI — and for `.ipk` there is an upstream tool that
does it, needing no keypair and no distro-specific build framework. For `.apk`
the equivalent is either implementing a signed three-stream format by hand or
importing Alpine's `abuild` into a Debian-based build image. That cost is paid
on every build and every recipe; the client is paid once.

The format-churn line matters more than it looks, too. A format with no users
on our architecture and an in-progress v2→v3 transition is a thing to track
forever for no benefit, since we can never consume anyone else's packages
anyway.

## Decision

**apk, and the `.apk` format** — apk-tools 3, cross-built here and carrying one
local patch, with `apk mkpkg` and `apk mkndx` as the packager.

**This reverses the original decision, and the table above is what it was made
on.** That decision was opkg and `.ipk`, driving upstream's `opkg-build`, and it
turned on one argument: every package is produced here on every build, so the
winner is whichever format is cheapest to *produce*, and `.ipk` had an upstream
tool where `.apk` meant `abuild`, a keypair and an Alpine host. **Two lines of
the comparison were wrong**, which the proof of concept below found out:

* `apk mkpkg` is an applet of apk itself — `-I key:value` metadata, `-F`
  directory, no keypair required, no `abuild`, no Alpine host. The "making a
  package" row described apk-tools 2.
* The client was counted a wash. It is better than a wash: openssl and zlib were
  already cross-built for CPython, and **libarchive existed in this tree only for
  opkg**. Adopting apk *removes* a cross-build.

What made it possible at all is that apk resolves its database relative to
`--root` and uses the same root as the file destination, while `/` here is a
read-only squashfs. `pkgs/3rdparty/apk-tools/prefix.patch` splits the two —
upstream already carries `root_fd` and `dest_fd` separately and merely aliases
them — so the database lands under `$MODDIR` and files still extract at `/`.
That is opkg's compile-time `VARDIR` plus `dest root /`, in apk's spelling.

**What it cost is a carried patch**, against an internal with one consumer, on a
branch mid v2→v3 transition, on an architecture with no upstream apk port to
share the rebasing. That is the standing risk and it does not go away. Set
against it: the feed is now **signed and verified on the printer**, which the
opkg feed never was.

The migration itself is recorded below under "The migration, as it happened".

## The apk proof of concept  *(built and measured; it is now the feed)*

Run it with `make packages PKG=apk-tools && ./tools/replica/run-apk-poc.py`.
The recipe is `pkgs/3rdparty/apk-tools/`, the case is
`tools/replica/printer/case-apk-poc.sh`, and everything below happened on the
printer's real rootfs under qemu-mipsel rather than in an argument.

**What was under test** is not "is apk nicer" — it is the one thing the
comparison could not settle by reading: apk resolves its database, `world`,
`arch` and lock file relative to `--root`, and takes the *same* root as the
destination for package files. This printer's `/` is a read-only squashfs.

**Measured first, because it decides the shape of everything else: `/lib/apk`
and `/etc/apk` cannot be created.** `mkdir` and `ln -s` both return
`Read-only file system`, with a control write under `/usr/data` succeeding in
the same run. The mount table (`docs/printer-replica.md`) says why — `/` is
`overlay (ro)`, `/usr/prog` and `/usr/data` are `rw` — and it is the same fact
that put the s6-rc compiled database under `$MODDIR/etc` rather than `/etc`
(`docs/notes/80-s6-migration.md`). So the symlink-into-`$MODDIR` idea is not
available: there is nowhere to put the symlink.

**`pkgs/3rdparty/apk-tools/prefix.patch`, 102 lines, all in `src/context.c`.**
Upstream already separates the two roots — `apk_ctx` carries `root_fd` *and*
`dest_fd`, `database.c` uses the first for the db and `fs_fsys.c` uses the
second for package files, and `app_extract.c` already overrides `dest_fd` by
itself. `context.c` merely aliases them (`ac->dest_fd = ac->root_fd`). The
patch defaults the database root to `$MODDIR`, opens `dest_fd` on `/`, and
sets `APK_NO_CHROOT` for that case so a maintainer script still sees the real
`/usr/prog`. That is opkg's compile-time `VARDIR` plus `dest root /`, in apk's
spelling.

It is **inert unless the build asks for it**: undefined,
`APK_DEFAULT_DB_ROOT` is `"/"` and every branch folds away to upstream's
behaviour. The prefix is passed in from the recipe rather than written into
the patch, so `$MODDIR` stays spelled once, in `bin/common.sh` — the trap
opkg's `VARDIR`, s6's `libexecdir` and execline's `shebangdir` all sprang.

**The whole loop closed on mipsel**, in one run of the case:

* `apk --version` → `apk-tools 3.0.7, compiled for mipsel`, in a bare
  environment.
* `--initdb` with **no `--root`** wrote `$MODDIR/lib/apk/db/{installed,
  scripts.tar.gz,triggers}` and `$MODDIR/etc/apk/{arch,world}`, and `/lib/apk`
  and `/etc/apk` still did not exist afterwards.
* `apk mkpkg` built a package **on the printer**, `apk add` installed it, the
  file landed at its `$MODDIR`-absolute path, `apk info -L` listed it, and
  `apk del` removed it leaving nothing.

### The two comparison lines this corrects

* **"Making a package: three concatenated gzip streams with an RSA signature"
  and "realistically `abuild` + a keypair, and `abuild` assumes an Alpine
  host".** Wrong for v3. `apk mkpkg` is an applet of the same binary, takes
  `-I key:value` metadata and a `-F` directory, needs no keypair, and produced
  a working package here — cross-built, running under qemu, on the printer.
  The argument that `.ipk` is cheaper to *produce* was the deciding one, and
  this is the half of it that does not hold.
* **"On-device client: apk-tools + zlib + openssl", counted as a wash.** It is
  better than a wash. openssl and zlib were already cross-built for CPython, so
  `PKG_BUILD_DEPENDS` is two packages we already had — and **libarchive exists
  in this tree only for opkg**. Adopting apk deletes a cross-build rather than
  adding one.

### Certificates: not for packages, only for `https://`

Worth separating, because "apk needs openssl" invites the wrong conclusion on
a printer that has no trust store.

**The printer has none — measured, in the same run.** `/etc/ssl/certs`,
`/usr/lib/ssl/certs`, `/usr/share/ca-certificates` and `$MODDIR/ssl/certs` all
hold **zero entries**, and neither `cert.pem` exists. That is exactly what
`tools/python/README.md` already says under "The gap: there are no CA
certificates" — our openssl is configured `--openssldir=$MODDIR/ssl` and
nothing ships a bundle into it.

**Package verification does not care.** apk reads signing keys with
`PEM_read_bio_PUBKEY` (`src/crypto_openssl.c`) — raw public keys, not X.509,
so there is no chain to build and no CA store to consult. Measured end to end
on the printer, with every directory above empty:

* a package built with `apk mkpkg --sign-key` and its public half dropped in
  `$MODDIR/etc/apk/keys/` installed **without `--allow-untrusted`**;
* the same package with the key removed was refused —
  `ERROR: UNTRUSTED signature`, exit 99. The check is real, not vacuous.

So a signed feed on a stick, or over plain `http://`, needs no certificates at
all. This is also strictly better than what the feed has today: opkg signs the
*index* and our `bin/build-packages.sh` signs nothing, so nothing is verified
on the printer now.

**`https://` is the one thing that needs a bundle.** libfetch defaults to
`SSL_VERIFY_PEER`; with no `CA_CERT_FILE` compiled in it falls back to
`SSL_CTX_set_default_verify_paths()`, which resolves to `$MODDIR/ssl` — empty
— so every verified connection fails. `apk --no-check-certificate` sets
`SSL_VERIFY_NONE` and turns that off. (Read from `libfetch/common.c`, not
measured: the replica has no network.)

That makes the certificate question a **pre-existing gap this does not
change** — the same ~200KB `ca-certificates` bundle Moonraker and CPython
already want — and not an apk problem. It only becomes one the day a feed is
served over https, and until then `--no-check-certificate` or `http://` is the
same trade the interpreter already lives with.

### What it cost, which is the honest other half

* **The legacy Makefile assumes Alpine.** `portability/` — `strlcpy` and
  friends — is wired into the *meson* build only. Against glibc 2.29 the link
  fails on `strlcpy` alone; the recipe compiles upstream's own shim as one
  object. Add `-lpthread -ldl` (separate libraries until glibc 2.34) and
  `-latomic` (mips32 has no 64-bit atomics, so `__atomic_load_8` is a library
  call, and nothing in the error message says "mips").
* **`-l:libapk.a` and `--start-group`.** `src/Makefile` says `LIBS_apk :=
  -lapk` with both `libapk.so` and `libapk.a` present, so the binary comes out
  needing `$MODDIR/lib` on the loader path — measured: bare, it dies with
  `libapk.so.3.0.0: cannot open shared object file`. Linking the archive in
  instead means the ordering `cmd_ld` imposes ($(LIBS) *before* $(LIBS_apk))
  starts to matter, which the shared build had hidden. The result is one 4.2MB
  binary whose every `NEEDED` is a rootfs library — the same shape as
  `anvil-opkg`, and all four confirmed present on the machine.
* **`--arch mipsel_xburst2` at `initdb`.** The compiled-in arch is bare
  `mipsel`, so a package built for this feed's architecture name is refused as
  `uninstallable`. Written into the database once, it is apk's answer to
  opkg's `arch mipsel_xburst2 10` config line.
* **A carried patch, forever.** This is the cost that does not go away.
  `dest_fd` has exactly one consumer in the tree; it is an internal, not an
  API, and upstream can collapse it back into `root_fd` without anyone
  calling that a breaking change. v3.0.7 is the tip of an actively developed
  branch mid v2→v3 transition, on an architecture with no upstream apk port to
  share the rebasing with. This repo bumped opkg 0.6.3→0.7.0 *specifically to
  avoid* carrying a patch.

**Nothing installs `anvil-apk-tools`.** The feed is still `.ipk`,
`bin/payload.sh` still installs it with opkg, and this recipe exists so the
next revision of the decision is made against measurements rather than against
the table above.

## The migration, as it happened

Sequenced so that the producer and the payload assembler were never broken at
the same time. A `PKG_FORMAT` switch in `bin/common.sh` made each step land
alone — one build produced one format, there was never a dual feed — and it was
deleted with the opkg path.

**A native apk had to exist first.** `apk mkpkg` and `apk mkndx` run on the
build machine, so `tools/apk-host/build.sh` builds one from the same pinned
checkout, *unpatched*, into `work/host/bin/apk`. `libssl-dev` replaced
`libarchive-dev` as the one documented exception to `versions.env`, for the
same reason: a build tool that never leaves the container.

**It is built ON DEMAND, and there is no target for it.** `bin/build-packages.sh`
runs `tools/apk-host/build.sh` and that script caches on the pin, so the second
call is a stamp comparison. There was a `make apk-host` for a while, and it was
an anomaly: the cross toolchain is unpacked by `pkg_toolchain` and the
build-python compiled by `pkg_buildpython`, both on demand and both stamped.
The one tool that writes every package had no business being the one thing a
person had to remember to build first.

**Then the metadata was made apk-legal while still under opkg**, which is the
step that de-risked everything after it:

* `Version:` became `1.2.3-r1`. apk's `apk_version_validate` rejects a bare
  `-1`; opkg reads the same string as upstream `1.2.3` revision `r1` and is
  unbothered. **Four recipes carried versions apk cannot parse at all** —
  `klipper` and `timelapse` spelled a commit `+git<sha>` where the grammar's
  hash slot is `~`, `x264` carried a snapshot name whose `-2245` reads as a
  malformed release, and `helixscreen` had `0.99.115.creator5.3`, where apk
  allows one trailing letter and then only a suffix from a closed set of nine
  words. All four were valid opkg versions, which is why nothing had noticed.
  `pkg_version_ok` now gates every recipe.
* `PKG_ARCH=all` emits `noarch`. apk interns that literal and compares against
  it, so `all` reads as an unknown architecture.
* The filename moved behind one function, `pkg_pkgfile`. It had been spelled in
  four places, which was safe only because the `.ipk` name separates name from
  version with `_`; the `.apk` name uses `-`, so `anvil-python-*` matches
  `anvil-python-pillow-11.0.0-r1.apk` and a package that was never built looks
  present.

**Two bugs this shook out, both silent, both found by a gate rather than by
reading:**

* **The prune deleted seventeen packages it had just built.** The `all` →
  `noarch` mapping went into the emitter and not into `pkg_pkgfile`, so the
  prune's expected set named `_all.ipk`, did not find it, and removed the real
  files. `make packages` exited 0.
* **Whitespace-separated `Depends` dropped nineteen packages.** apk's list is
  whitespace-separated and opkg's is comma-separated, and stripping the commas
  for both formats looked harmless. `pkg_parse.c` splits that field on `,` and
  **nothing else**, so the whole list became one dependency whose name
  contained spaces, resolved to nothing, and opkg neither warned nor failed.
  `make build` shipped a payload with no Tornado in it. The commas now come off
  inside `emit_apk` alone, and
  `test_the_payload_is_dependency_closed` is what would catch it next time —
  nothing else asked, because the roots were right and a test that walks the
  payload cannot notice a file that is absent.

**The bootstrap changed shape.** A v3 `.apk` begins with `ADBd` magic and is not
a tar stream, so there is no apk equivalent of the `ar -p | gunzip | tar` that
unpacked `anvil-opkg` by hand — you cannot open a package without a package
manager. `bin/build-payload.py` puts the cross-built binary on the stick at
`/mnt/apk` instead. It is the same build `anvil-apk-tools` contains, that
package installs normally, and the bootstrap copy never lands.

**Ownership needed a synthetic root.** apk records owners by NAME against
`<--root>/etc/passwd`, and the build lane runs `--user` with no passwd entry —
so every file in every package was recorded `nobody`, silently, and would have
installed as uid 65534. `bin/build-packages.sh` writes a two-line passwd/group
naming the build user `root` and points `--root` at it.
`test_a_package_is_owned_by_root_whoever_built_it` and its inverse hold that
shut. `--rootnode` is *not* the flag for this; it is a deprecated alias for
`--compat`.

**The feed is signed now, which it never was.** opkg signs the index and
`bin/build-packages.sh` signed nothing, so nothing was verified on a printer.
`./bin/apk-keygen.sh` makes an RSA pair, `APK_SIGN_KEY` in `config.env` points
at the private half, and the public half both seeds the stick (so the first
install can verify) and ships in `anvil-core` (so the printer keeps trusting).
An empty `APK_SIGN_KEY` still builds an unsigned feed, deliberately: `make
packages` has to run on a bare checkout or the packaging lane stops being a CI
gate. **RSA or Ed25519 only** — ECDSA signatures are randomised and two builds
of one tree would stop being byte-identical.

**Where the key lives, on each of the two machines that build.** On a
developer's, outside the checkout — `./bin/apk-keygen.sh ~/.anvil/anvil.rsa`,
and `APK_SIGN_KEY` in the gitignored `config.env` — so neither half is
something the repository can commit. The build runs in a container that mounts
only the checkout, so the Makefile reads that path out of `config.env` and
bind-mounts the key's *directory* read-only; without that the key is visible in
the developer's shell and invisible to `apk`, which is a confusing enough
failure to have its own test.

In CI it is the `APK_SIGN_KEY` repository secret, holding the **private key
PEM** itself rather than a path. `release.yml` writes it to `$RUNNER_TEMP`
(outside the checkout, so no later step can archive it into a release), derives
the public half with `openssl pkey -pubout` rather than storing it as a second
secret that could drift out of step with the first, and names the file in
`config.env`. With the secret unset the release is built **unsigned with a
warning** rather than failing: a fork has no such secret, and a firmware that
cannot be built by someone else is worse than one whose feed is untrusted on a
stick the printer was already handed by hand.

**Two gates retired rather than moved.** apk's installed database is plain text
(`F:` sets a directory, `R:` names a file in it), so the ownership check reads
one file where it used to glob `info/*.list`. And it carries **no clock at
all** — apk records no install time and `mkpkg` sets no build-time — so the
`Installed-Time` normalisation `case-build-payload.sh` had to do on every build
is gone, and the test now asserts the *absence* of a `t:` line. Clock-free by
construction rather than by repair.

## Facts established by measurement, not by reading

Each of these was run, not assumed. They constrain the phases below.

* **Our cross-built opkg installs our packages, on mipsel** — measured when
  opkg was still a *static musl* binary. Run under `qemu-mipsel-static` against
  an `--offline-root`, it installed both packages of the day, reported them
  under `list-installed`, listed their files, and removed both leaving nothing
  behind; the opkg it installed then ran and reported its own version. The
  whole loop, closed on the target architecture.

  **This has not been re-run since opkg moved to dynamic glibc**, and the
  command changed with it — a dynamic binary needs `qemu -L <sysroot>`. See the
  end of phase 0. Nothing suggests it broke; nobody has checked.
* **opkg bakes its state directory in at compile time.** Its status file
  landed at `/usr/data/anvil/var/lib/opkg` because it was configured
  `--prefix=/usr/data/anvil` — `--offline-root` does not move it. Built with
  any other prefix it comes up believing nothing is installed and reinstalls
  the world. This is the *third* instance of the same trap on this printer,
  after s6's `libexecdir` and execline's `shebangdir` (both in `versions.env`).
  On this machine the `--prefix` is not a preference, and that is why `$MODDIR`
  now lives in `bin/common.sh` where a recipe cannot spell it differently.
* **opkg 0.7.0, not 0.6.3, if you build against musl.** Two files in 0.6.3
  (`opkg_remove.c`, `opkg_archive.c`) call `basename()` without including
  `<libgen.h>`, getting away with it only because glibc's `<string.h>` also
  declares a differently-behaved `basename`. musl does not, so gcc 14 stops at
  "implicit declaration" — and on a compiler that merely warned, the returned
  pointer would have been truncated through an implicit `int`. 0.7.0 adds both
  includes. That was the difference between a pin bump and carrying a patch.
* **opkg will not configure without libarchive.** Measured: `./configure`
  hard-fails at the `pkg-config` check. There is no internal tar fallback any
  more. libarchive and zlib are therefore build dependencies, cut down to
  gzip-and-tar and linked *into* the static binary; neither ships as a file.
* **libtool eats `-static`.** A program configured `LDFLAGS=-static` comes out
  dynamically linked anyway, because libtool defines that flag to mean
  "prefer static libtool libraries" and does not pass it to gcc. `-all-static`
  is the one that means it, and it cannot go through `./configure` (configure's
  own link probes call gcc directly, which rejects it), so it goes to `make`.
  Nothing relies on this any more — opkg links glibc dynamically now and gets
  its static zlib and libarchive simply by there being no `.so` of either in
  the sysroot — but the *check* it motivated stayed, inverted: `readelf -d` on
  the finished binary, expecting `libc.so.6` and nothing of ours. The lesson is
  the check, not the flag. A link that is not what it was asked to be shows up
  as a `NEEDED` entry nobody looks at, and then as a missing `.so` on a
  printer.
* **opkg-utils has no release tarball, anywhere.** Upstream's cgit has
  snapshots disabled (every format returns "Unsupported snapshot format"),
  `downloads.yoctoproject.org` carries opkg but not opkg-utils, and the GitHub
  mirror at `shr-project/opkg-utils` last saw a commit in 2012 and has no tags.
  So it is pinned by **git commit** — a hash of the whole tree, the same
  guarantee the sha256s give, in git's spelling — and `bin/fetch-assets.sh`
  verifies `HEAD` against it and refuses a dirty checkout.
* **The printer's busybox cannot be assumed to have `ar`.** It is 1.31.1 built
  small — no `timeout`, no `nc`, no `ionice`, all measured on the replica.
  That is why the printer gets a real cross-built opkg (`pkgs/3rdparty/opkg/`),
  which reads `.ipk` through its own linked-in libarchive rather than shelling
  out to tools the busybox may not have.
* **All four packages are reproducible.** `rm -rf work/pkg work/packages` and a
  full recompile produce byte-identical `.ipk` files. That is a measurement of
  *these* packages and this toolchain, not a property of the build system — a
  package whose upstream embeds a timestamp will not have it, and the honest
  response is to record which ones do rather than to claim the fleet is
  reproducible.
* **A static archive is not reproducible until it is made so, and this
  toolchain cannot do it alone.** `ar` stores an mtime and the builder's
  uid/gid in every member header, plus another timestamp in the symbol index —
  none of which `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` or `opkg-build`'s `-o 0 -g 0` reaches,
  because they are *inside* a file the tarball merely contains. Measured: two
  cold builds of `pkgs/3rdparty/zlib` produced different sha256, every member reading
  `1000/1000 Aug 28 15:10`. `objcopy -D` normalises the member headers, but the
  cross binutils is **2.27** and its `ranlib -D` writes a *fresh current*
  timestamp into the index instead of zeroing it. The index is therefore
  rewritten with the build machine's `ranlib` (2.40 in `docker/Dockerfile.build`),
  which is version-sensitive and worth knowing before anyone changes the image.
  The proof it produces a valid index is downstream: opkg links against both
  archives, and a broken index fails that link.
* **The ABI gate's `e_flags` whitelist was a proxy, and object files exposed
  it.** It accepted exactly `0x70001405` and `0x70001407`, both measured from
  linked *binaries* — where crt startup objects set `EF_MIPS_NOREORDER`, so
  every executable and shared object read one or the other. Individual objects
  need not: libarchive's `xxhash.o` is `0x70001406`, identical ABI, no
  NOREORDER, and the old gate called it wrong. The ABI is the high bits
  (`0x70001400` = arch32r2 | o32 | nan2008); the low three (noreorder, pic,
  cpic) say nothing about whether the kernel will exec the file. The gate now
  masks them, and reads **every** header rather than one — `readelf -h` on an
  archive prints one per member, 122 for `libarchive.a`, and the single-line
  version handed a multi-line string to a comparison expecting one word.
* **A cache stamp compared by one file and written by another will drift.**
  `bin/fetch-assets.sh` compared `work/.s6/.version` against
  `"$SKALIBS_VERSION $S6_VERSION"` while `bin/patch.sh` wrote three fields into
  it. The test could therefore never be false: a 71MB toolchain was re-hashed
  on every run, downloaded on every cold one, and the comment above the
  condition described a fast path that had never once been taken. `$S6_STAMP`
  now lives in `bin/common.sh`, the recipes compute theirs in `pkg_stamp`, and
  `test_no_cache_stamp_is_spelled_in_two_places` keeps it that way.

## The phases, as they were built  *(historical, and opkg-era)*

Everything from here to "What this does not fix" describes how the feed was
BUILT UP, and it was built up on opkg. The structure it produced — a recipe per
cross-build, one recipe one source, the feed as the interface between recipes,
the payload assembled by installing that feed inside the replica — is all still
exactly true and is the part worth reading. The tool names in it are not: read
`opkg-build` as `apk mkpkg`, `opkg-make-index` as `apk mkndx`, `CONTROL/control`
as `-I key:value`, and `.ipk` as `.apk`. The migration section above lists what
actually changed.

Kept rather than rewritten because these sections are the record of *why* the
layout is the shape it is, and a reason survives the tool it was first written
about.

## Phase 0 — the proof of concept  *(implemented)*

Four packages, end to end, beside the existing build and changing nothing that
ships.

    make packages            # or ./bin/build-packages.sh [name...]

    work/packages/anvil-zlib_1.3.1-1_mipsel_xburst2.ipk
    work/packages/anvil-libarchive_3.7.9-1_mipsel_xburst2.ipk
    work/packages/anvil-libsodium_1.0.20-1_mipsel_xburst2.ipk
    work/packages/anvil-opkg_0.7.0-1_mipsel_xburst2.ipk
    work/packages/Packages{,.gz}

Needs **no stock FlashForge package**, which is most of the point: packaging
has to be runnable in CI on a bare checkout, or the gate only runs where the
proprietary firmware is and stops being a gate.

| file | what it is |
| ---- | ---------- |
| `pkgs/lib.sh` | the part of a cross-build that is the same for every package |
| `pkgs/3rdparty/zlib/` | the library that was cross-built **twice**, now built once |
| `pkgs/3rdparty/libarchive/` | what opkg reads `.ipk` files with; builds against `anvil-zlib` |
| `pkgs/3rdparty/opkg/` | opkg itself; builds against both of the above |
| `pkgs/3rdparty/libsodium/` | `build.sh` + `pkg.conf`. **`bin/patch.sh` section 5d's build, moved.** |
| `bin/build-packages.sh` | orders the recipes, lays out each tree, drives `opkg-build`, indexes the feed |
| `qa/static/test_packages.py` | 112 tests, no toolchain needed |

### One recipe builds one package

This is the rule the layout exists to enforce, and it did not hold at first.
`pkgs/3rdparty/opkg/build.sh` used to unpack zlib, build it into a private sysroot,
unpack libarchive, build that against it, and only then build the binary it
shipped: one script, three libraries, one package. Section 5b still does the
same thing with skalibs and s6.

What that costs is not tidiness. A library built inside somebody else's recipe
has no version, no package and no way to be reused, so the next consumer builds
its own — **zlib was cross-built twice in this tree**, once in section 5c for
CPython and once here for libarchive, from one pinned tarball with the same
flags, and neither copy could see the other. Splitting them is what makes the
feed the interface between recipes rather than an output nobody reads.

So a recipe now declares `PKG_BUILD_DEPENDS`, and `pkg_deps` fills its sysroot
by unpacking those packages **out of the feed**. Building against the package
rather than against the build tree is the part worth paying for: a package that
forgets to ship a header fails the next recipe's configure, on the build that
produced it.

### opkg is not special, and nothing waits for it

The obvious objection to a feed-based build is that it needs a package manager
to install the build dependencies, and the package manager is itself a package.
It does not. `opkg-unbuild` is upstream's own inverse of `opkg-build` and comes
from the same pinned `opkg-utils` checkout, so a sysroot can be filled without
a working opkg existing anywhere. There is no bootstrap stage, no ordering rule
beyond declared dependencies, and no qemu in the build path.

`bin/build-packages.sh` topologically sorts the recipes and packages each one
before the next is built, because the next one reads it out of the feed.
Alphabetical order — what iterating `pkgs/*/` gives you — puts libarchive before
the zlib it needs.

### The split in `pkgs/lib.sh`

* `pkg_conf` / `pkg_stamp` — a recipe's metadata and its cache key, both read
  from `pkg.conf`. The stamp includes the toolchain and, recursively, the
  stamps of everything the recipe builds against, so a zlib bump rebuilds
  libarchive and opkg with nobody maintaining a composite stamp by hand.
* `pkg_order` — dependency-first build order, and the closure of a single
  named recipe so that `PKG=opkg` builds what opkg needs.
* `pkg_begin` / `pkg_end` — the stamped build cache, which is what lets
  `bin/fetch-assets.sh` skip a 203MB toolchain download.
* `pkg_toolchain` — unpack, write the gcc wrappers that bake `-EL -mnan=2008`
  into the *driver* (autotools link lines do not all forward `CFLAGS`), and
  then **prove the wrapper emits the right ABI** before anything is built on
  it. That step existed in section 5b and was missing from 5d; the copies had
  drifted before there was anywhere to put them.
* `pkg_deps` — unpack this recipe's build dependencies out of the feed with
  `opkg-unbuild` and point `CPPFLAGS`, `LDFLAGS` and pkg-config at the result.
  The sysroot mirrors the printer, dependencies living under `$MODDIR` inside
  it, which is why `PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR` is set to the sysroot rather than
  emptied: the `.pc` files say `prefix=/usr/data/anvil` and that variable is
  what turns them into paths that exist on the build machine.
* `pkg_autotools` — configure, make, install into the staging tree.
* `pkg_ship` — copy out what the package contains, normalise static archives,
  strip ELF with the *cross* strip. What a package contains depends on what it
  is for: a library that ships to the printer ships its `.so`, and a library
  that exists to be built against ships headers, `.a` and `.pc`.

`qa/static/test_packages.py` gates this directly: a recipe that does not source
`pkgs/lib.sh`, spells its own `-mnan=2008`, unpacks its own toolchain, calls
`./configure` itself, or unpacks more than one source tarball fails the suite.
The one named exception is zlib, whose configure has never accepted `--host`.
A recipe that needs something `pkgs/lib.sh` cannot express should *grow*
`pkgs/lib.sh` — that is what the gate is for.

**Not yet shared:** `bin/patch.sh` section 5b (s6 and skalibs) still carries
its own copy of all of this, and is the remaining instance of one script
building two libraries. Phase 1 is what turns it into recipes.

### The property everything rests on

**A library is compiled once, whichever vehicle it ships in.** `bin/patch.sh`
runs `pkgs/3rdparty/libsodium/build.sh` and stages its output into the payload exactly as
before, and `bin/build-packages.sh` packages the same tree. Section 5c now does
the same with zlib: it runs `pkgs/3rdparty/zlib/build.sh` and stages the result into
CPython's dependency sysroot instead of compiling its own copy. While that
holds, the tarball's copy and the package's copy cannot be different libraries
wearing one version number — and
`test_the_package_and_the_payload_share_one_build` asserts it rather than
trusting it.

**Gate:** `pytest qa/static` (127 tests, 29 of them packaging) plus `make
packages` from a cold cache producing four byte-reproducible `.ipk` files and
an index. Both pass.

**Not re-run since opkg moved to glibc:** the end-to-end check where our own
cross-built opkg installs and removes this feed. It used to be a bare
`qemu-mipsel-static` invocation because opkg was a static musl binary; a
dynamic one needs a sysroot, so the command is now

    qemu-mipsel-static -L work/.mips-toolchain/mips-gcc720-glibc229/mips-linux-gnu/libc \
        work/pkg/opkg/bin/opkg --offline-root <tmpdir> install work/packages/*.ipk

(`readelf -l` says the interpreter is `/lib/ld-linux-mipsn8.so.1`, the nan2008
loader, which that sysroot provides and the printer's rootfs must too — the
same loader the interpreter already links.) Worth running before anyone leans
on this.

## Phase 1 — a recipe per cross-build  *(~3–5 days)*

Turn the rest of `bin/patch.sh`'s builds into recipes, the way libsodium
became one —

    klipper ✔  toolchange-config
    python ✔  python-<18 packages> ✔
    openssl ✔  libffi ✔  sqlite ✔  xz ✔  expat ✔  bzip2 ✔
    zlib ✔  libarchive ✔  libsodium ✔  opkg ✔
    skalibs ✔  execline ✔  s6 ✔  s6-rc ✔
    mainsail ✔  moonraker ✔  helixscreen ✔  anvil-core ✔

**Done: 38 recipes producing 41 packages.**
Section 5b — the last place where one script built two libraries — is four
recipes (`skalibs`, `execline`, `s6`, `s6-rc`), and moving them off the musl
toolchain removed the second libc from this tree entirely. Section 5c, which
was 825 lines, is `pkgs/3rdparty/python` plus eighteen `pkgs/3rdparty/python-*` and 115 lines of
staging.

**What splitting CPython actually bought.** Not tidiness. The old section had
one cache and two stamps, and its own comment explained that a bumped Pillow
rebuilt the interpreter and all eighteen packages — because a wheel could only
be cross-built during the few minutes when an untrimmed staging tree, a private
sysroot of static libraries and a throwaway x86-64 build-python happened to
exist at once. Those are now, respectively: the feed's `anvil-python-dev`
package, each recipe's own sysroot, and `pkg_buildpython`'s shared cache. None
of them is a passing moment, so `make packages PKG=python-pillow` is a Pillow
build and nothing else.

It also made eighteen invisible things visible. Each package now carries its
upstream version into the index, `anvil-moonraker` declares the thirteen it
imports, and a printer that does not want gcode thumbnails can leave the 500KB
of Pillow uninstalled — a decision that could not previously be expressed.

**Klipper was the last one, and it needed one new knob.** `klippy/chelper` has
no Makefile and never has: on a machine with a compiler klippy builds
`c_helper.so` at first run from the argument list in
`klippy/chelper/__init__.py`, and this printer has no compiler. So the build
system for that `.so` genuinely is one `gcc` line, which `pkg_build` could not
express — it always ran `make`. `PKG_CC_SHARED` is that line, appended to
`$CC -shared -fPIC`: the recipe states Klipper's own `COMPILE_ARGS` and
`pkg_build` keeps ownership of the compiler, so the ABI flags stay spelled in
exactly one place. A knob, not a verb, for the reason the header of
`pkg_build` gives about the three mechanisms with one user each.

Two things the recipe took with it. `KLIPPER_FORK` — the `config.env` knob
that pointed the build at a local checkout instead of the pin — is **gone**: a
recipe names its source exactly once, a checkout beside a pinned tarball is
the second source that rule forbids, and it is the *same* variable that let
v20260824 ship a klippy tree nobody had built. `test/test-chelper.py` had
already stopped falling back to reading `KLIPPER_FORK` out of `config.env` when
given no argument — that fallback printed `SKIP: no KLIPPER_FORK configured`, a
green line for a check that had not run — and the script itself is gone now,
deleted with the rest of `test/`.

The package installs the tree under `$MODDIR/klipper`, where nothing reads it
yet: klippy is still started by the stock `/usr/prog/klipper/klipperDaemon`,
so `bin/patch.sh` stages the recipe's output into the SOFTWARE component as
before. Phase 7 of `docs/notes/80-s6-migration.md` is what makes the installed
copy the live one. [Superseded: phase 7 landed. The `klipper` s6-rc service
execs `$FF_PYTHON` against `$MODDIR/klipper/klippy`, and the software-component
copy is gone.]

`patch.sh` keeps staging the payload from those same trees, so the shipped
tarball does not change. The work is mechanical; the risk is in the two builds
with the most measured constraints behind them (5b's s6 prefix, 5c's CPython
cross-build), which should go last — and both are exactly the shape
`pkgs/lib.sh` already handles, since it was written from them.

**Gate, corrected.** This used to read "the `anvil.tar.xz` built after this
phase is byte-identical to the one built before it". That cannot be the gate,
for two independent reasons, and stating it that way meant nobody could tell a
real regression from an expected difference:

* Moving s6 to dynamic glibc changes those binaries **by design**. A tarball
  that did not change would mean the change had not happened.
* `bin/pack.sh` builds `anvil.tar.xz` with a bare `tar -cf`, with no
  `--sort=name`, `--mtime` or `--owner`. It carries filesystem order and
  per-file mtimes, so it has never been byte-reproducible and the stated gate
  could never have passed.

What is checked instead: the assembled `work/modpayload-root` **tree** — file list,
modes and content hashes — is unchanged except for the components a change
deliberately rebuilt. The `.ipk` files themselves ARE byte-reproducible and
that is checked directly: two cold `make packages` runs produce identical
archives. Measured over all 40 with `work/pkg`, the shared build-python and
the unpacked toolchain all deleted in between — so the x86-64 interpreter that
generates every mipsel extension module is itself rebuilt rather than reused.

### A recipe owns its files, and the directory says how they ship

The recipes came first and the repository's own files stayed where they were:
one top-level `payload/` tree organised by DESTINATION (`init.d/`, `bin/`,
`etc/s6/`, `klipper/config/`) plus an `assets/` directory of three .conf
files. That was right when there was one owner. With 38 recipes it hid three
different kinds of file behind identical-looking paths, and the only thing
recording which package owned any of them was a thirty-line comment at the top
of `pkgs/anvil-core/build.sh`.

Files now live with the recipe that owns them, in one of three subtrees:

    pkgs/<recipe>/payload/   staged into the .ipk, laid out as it lands under
                            $MODDIR -- payload/init.d/S60nginx installs as
                            $MODDIR/init.d/S60nginx and no recipe says so
    pkgs/<recipe>/prog/      placed on /usr/prog by bin/patch.sh
    pkgs/<recipe>/seed/      templated or seeded user state

Recipes themselves sit at two depths, and `pkgs/lib.sh`'s `pkg_dir` is the
only thing that knows it: `pkgs/<name>/` for a recipe that carries files of
this repo (four), `pkgs/3rdparty/<name>/` for one that builds a pinned tarball
and carries none (thirty-four). That is for `ls pkgs/` and nothing else — no
package, no dependency and no stamp knows which side a recipe is on. The line
is deliberately mechanical rather than "do we modify it", which drifts: the
day somebody patches zlib nobody would agree on which side it belongs, whereas
"does it carry files of ours" is a fact about the tree and a test can demand
the move.

`installer/` holds the two files that are never files on a printer at all:
`run-pre.sh` and `run-append.sh` are spliced into FlashForge's own `run.sh`.
`qa/static/test_recipe_layout.py` fails if a fourth kind of directory appears,
which is the failure this layout is actually for — a misfiled file is caught
by a build, an unruled directory is caught by nothing.

**prog/ and seed/ are the not-yet-packaged residue, and that is the point of
naming them.** Both empty out on the way to the end state. `seed/` got there
first and by a route this section did not predict: rather than a postinst
seeding `anvil.conf.default` when the real file is absent, `anvil.conf` was
removed outright and `seed/` left `anvil-core` with it. `prog/` empties when a
postinst run against a STAGING ROOT places
`/usr/prog/PROGRAM/software/firmwareExe` as a symlink into `$MODDIR`. The second is the interesting one, and it is only possible because
`/usr/prog` is written by a tarball this repo bakes, not by a flash we do not
control: the install can happen in the build container, which is what "the
tarball becomes a view of the feed" below already assumes. The trap there is
`$IPKG_INSTROOT` -- a postinst that writes a bare `/usr/prog/...` symlinks the
BUILD CONTAINER's root, the staging tree gets nothing, and the build stays
green.

**Ownership followed, once the files could be seen.** `anvil-core` had held
everything of ours for no better reason than being the first recipe written,
and with the files visible per-recipe the misfilings were obvious:
`moonraker.conf` went to `pkgs/moonraker` with the server it configures, the
`ff-*.cfg` to `pkgs/klipper-config`, and the two per-model chamber configs
became `anvil-klipper-creator5-config` and `anvil-klipper-creator5pro-config`
— which is the first use of `Provides`/`Conflicts` in this feed, on a virtual
`anvil-klipper-chamber-config` that either satisfies and neither may share.
The dependency runs from the model package to the shared one and not the
other way: `opkg install anvil-klipper-config` would otherwise resolve the
virtual name by picking whichever provider it found first, which is a coin
flip between two files describing different hardware. The model is the one
fact opkg cannot work out for itself, so it is the name you install.
The model stopped being a property of the build: two builds of one commit used
to produce different bytes under one version number, with nothing in the feed
or on the printer recording which machine they were for.

Two flags became honest as a side effect, and both are behaviour changes worth
knowing about. `BUILD_TOOLCHANGE=0` used to ship the toolchanger's `.cfg`
anyway, because they rode in `anvil-core` while everything else the flag
controls was gated; it no longer does. `BUILD_MOONRAKER=0` used to overwrite
the printer's `moonraker.conf` with one written for a server it was not going
to install; it no longer does, which is what `docs/building.md` already said
the flag meant.

**What it cost and what it caught.** Nothing shipped changed: all 41 packages
are byte-identical across the move. It did surface one live bug --
HelixScreen's `printer_database.d` entry was hashed into ANVIL-CORE's
`PKG_STAMP_EXTRA`, so editing the json rebuilt a package that does not contain
it and left the one that does sitting in the cache. `pkg_payload_hash` is now
the one way a recipe keys its own files, and a recipe cannot hash somebody
else's.

## Phase 2 — the payload is the feed  *(assembly half: done)*

Split in two, and only the first half is done.

**The assembly half — done.** `bin/patch.sh` no longer stages anything. It
installs the feed into a staging root and ships what lands there:

    ./bin/build-packages.sh                       # the feed
    opkg --conf <generated> --force-postinstall \
         install <the runtime set>                # into work/modpayload-root
    tar -C work/modpayload-root/usr/data/anvil    # the payload

Eight sections that each ran a recipe and copied its build tree are gone, and
with them the hand-written `PKG_DEV_FILES` prune, three partial ABI gates and
the last `pkg_out` call. `patch.sh` went from 793 lines to about 700, and what
is left of it writes `/usr/prog` — FlashForge's tree, which no package of ours
may touch — plus the three files that are in the payload and in no package.

**The on-printer half — not started.** `.install-manifest` still exists and
`installer/run-append.sh` still deletes by it. Replacing it with opkg's own
`.list` files changes what happens on real printers during an upgrade and
rewrites what is now `qa/replica/test_upgrade.py`; it is a separate change
with a different risk profile. Keeping the halves apart is what made the first
one provable: on-printer behaviour is unchanged, so correctness reduced to a
payload diff.

**Cancelled rather than done -- see `86-wipe-and-extract.md`.** `$MODDIR` is
deleted wholesale on update now, so a printer never deletes selectively and
needs no file database for the purpose — ours or opkg's. There was nothing
left for this half to replace `.install-manifest` *with*. The `.list` files
still ship and still describe the payload; nothing reads them at upgrade
time.

### What it is assembled with

**The printer's own opkg, on the printer's own filesystem.** `bin/patch.sh`
runs `bin/build-payload.py`, which starts the replica, puts the feed on the
simulated stick and lets the machine's `opkg` install it. The tree is tarred
back out and becomes `$MODDIR`. Maintainer scripts therefore run where they
will run on a printer, and the install that ships is the install that was
tested.

The database is written by the same binary that will later read it on the
machine — not merely by the same program built twice — which is what makes
"phase 2 is a swap rather than a migration" true rather than an argument
about format compatibility.

**This is why `make build` needs the docker socket.** The build lane runs on
`RUNBUILD` (Makefile), which is `RUN` plus the socket and the socket's own
gid, and still `--user` so the output belongs to you. A build that could not
reach the daemon could not assemble a payload.

**A host opkg was the previous answer, and it is gone.** `pkg_buildopkg`
cross-built an x86-64 opkg from the same pinned tarball, cached at
`work/.opkg-host`, and installed the feed into a staging root with
`--offline-root`. It worked, but everything about it was an imitation of the
machine: `--prefix=$MODDIR` was mandatory and easy to get wrong (opkg bakes
its state directory in at compile time — `libopkg/Makefile.am`:
`-DVARDIR="@localstatedir@"` — so any other prefix comes up believing nothing
is installed and reinstalls the world), `--disable-shared` was mandatory for
the same reason one layer down, and postinst scripts had to be forced because
nothing could execute a MIPS binary. The replica has none of those problems
because it is not imitating anything.

**A chroot on the host was tried and rejected** before either of those. It
needs root: unprivileged `chroot` is `Operation not permitted` and
`unshare -Ur` is blocked by Docker's seccomp profile. The payload then comes
out root-owned and the build-lane user cannot delete it, so the next
`make build` dies on its own `rm -rf` — the failure `Makefile:48-61` exists
to prevent.

### What the set is

`bin/patch.sh` names twelve packages and lets `Depends` bring the rest: 31
installed, 19 of them pulled in and marked `Auto-Installed: yes`. The feed is
indexed (`src anvil file:$PKG_FEED` plus `opkg update`), so this is the same
resolution an `opkg install anvil-moonraker` performs on a printer — which
means the dependency metadata is exercised by every build instead of only when
somebody tries it.

`file:` is answered before curl is reached at all
(`libopkg/opkg_download.c:134`), which is why a `--disable-curl` opkg can
still resolve a feed.

**The gates reach here by absence.** A `PKG_WHEN`-gated recipe leaves no
`.ipk` in the feed, so `BUILD_HELIX=0` simply has no `anvil-helixscreen` to
install, with no `BUILD_*` flag restated outside the `pkg.conf` that owns it. The cost is that a *misspelled* root drops out
just as quietly, which is what `test_the_payload_roots_name_real_packages`
exists for. A missing **dependency** is still a hard error, raised by opkg.

**Four roots are Recommends, a field opkg does not have.**
`anvil-python-pillow` and `anvil-python-preprocess-cancellation` are
Moonraker's thumbnail path, which `pkgs/moonraker/pkg.conf` argues out of
`Depends` on the grounds that a printer without them still serves;
`anvil-python-greenlet` and `anvil-python-cffi` are klippy's, and
`pkgs/klipper/pkg.conf` cannot declare them while klippy still runs under
FlashForge's interpreter.

**An earlier version enumerated the closure by hand**, filtering
`pkg_recipes`. It worked and it hid the thing worth testing. It also had a trap
in it: `-dev` had to be filtered by package NAME, not by "has a runtime half",
because `execline`, `s6` and CPython ship both halves while `zlib`, `openssl`,
`sqlite`, `expat`, `libffi`, `xz`, `bzip2`, `libarchive` and `skalibs` ship
*only* a dev package and say so by setting `PKG_NAME=anvil-<x>-dev` outright.
Asking the first question installed all nine — 40 packages and 2165 ELF
objects where there should be 31 and 154. Roots and `Depends` cannot make that
mistake: nothing depends on a `-dev` package.

The one version that cannot be left to opkg is `anvil-core`'s. Its
`PKG_VERSION` is `MOD_VER`, which defaults to today's date, so a feed built
yesterday would resolve and install yesterday's `anvil-core` without
complaint. `patch.sh` checks for the expected filename before installing and
names `./bin/build-packages.sh` if it is absent.

The recipes whose version is a **pin** have the opposite problem.
`anvil-moonraker`, `anvil-klipper`, `anvil-helixscreen` and `anvil-timelapse`
ship files of ours beside an upstream tree, and apk decides whether to upgrade
from the version string alone: a change under `payload/` is new bytes under an
old name, so a printer already holding that version keeps what it has.
`PKG_RELEASE` is the field that moves — raise it when `payload/` changes, and
back to 1 when the pin itself moves. `PKG_STAMP_EXTRA="$(pkg_payload_hash)"`
is a different mechanism for a different reader: it makes *this build* notice
the edit and rebuild. It does not make a printer notice it.

The model is the one fact opkg cannot work out for itself: both chamber
configs are built every time, they own the same `config/printer.chamber.cfg`,
and they `Conflict`. opkg refuses the pair with exit 255 — measured — so
`$TARGET_MACHINE` picks one.

### The database ships

`$MODDIR/var/lib/opkg/{status,info/*}` is in the payload and in
`.install-manifest`. This is coherent with `installer/run-append.sh`: pass 1
deletes what the *old* manifest named, including the old database, and the new
tarball then extracts one that exactly describes the payload being extracted.
A `.tgz` flash is a full reset of `/usr/data/anvil`.

The alternatives are worse. Leaving it out defeats the point — an opkg with no
`status` believes nothing is installed. Keeping it out of the *manifest* only
is worse still: a package release N shipped and N+1 dropped would keep its
stanza forever while its files were gone.

**Known gap.** A printer that runs `opkg install` for something extra and then
flashes a `.tgz` keeps that package's files — they are in no manifest of ours
— but loses its stanza. That is inherent to running two install mechanisms at
once, and it dissolves when the manifest gives way to opkg's `.list` files.

**`Installed-Time` is normalised** after installing. opkg takes it from
`time()` and honours `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` only for a man-page date at configure
time, so two builds of one commit differed by one line per package — measured,
fixed, measured again.

### Maintainer scripts: what we learned, and what it costs

**opkg 0.7.0 does not run maintainer scripts under `--offline-root`**
(`libopkg/pkg.c:1339`, `opkg_cmd.c:342`) unless `--force-postinstall`, and it
**sets no `IPKG_INSTROOT` at all** — the variable does not appear anywhere in
its source.

The install passes `--force-postinstall`, but only to make opkg mark packages
`installed` rather than `unpacked`: nothing runs opkg on the printer after
`run-append.sh` extracts the tarball, so the extraction *is* the install and a
database saying otherwise would make the first real `opkg upgrade` argue with
the filesystem. No recipe defines a maintainer script, so nothing runs.

This contradicts an assumption made earlier in this document. The plan for
`firmwareExe` and `start.sh` was to package them and let a postinst place them
on `/usr/prog` from a staging root. That does not work as written: the script
would run on the build host with no `IPKG_INSTROOT` to tell it where the root
is. The options when that step arrives are to set an environment variable of
our own and have the script read it, or to leave those two files as the
`prog/` copies they are today. It needs its own design; it is not free.

### The gate this cleared

A payload built from the parent commit and from the migration, on the
synthetic stock fixture with the real vendored assets:

| | |
|---|---|
| files removed | 0 |
| content changes among 2778 shared files | 1 — `.install-manifest`, which lists the payload |
| mode changes | 0 |
| symlink changes | 0 |
| added | `klipper/**`, `var/lib/opkg/**`, `bin/opkg` |
| two builds in a row | byte-identical |

`bin/verify.sh` passed every check including the ship boundary; `make test`
ran `build-packages → unpack → patch → pack → verify` with 9 gates green.
(Measured while both existed. `bin/verify.sh` and `make test` have since been
retired -- the ship boundary is now `qa/replica/test_what_ships.py`, asked of
the installed machine.)

**One bug fell out of it.** `PKG_EXCLUDE` was applied with `find -name`, which
matches a basename at any depth, so `.version` deleted Mainsail's own
`www/mainsail/.version` along with the recipe stamp. `anvil-mainsail` had been
shipping without it, invisibly, because the payload was copied from
`work/pkg` where the file survived. Making the package's contents the
payload's contents is what surfaced it.

**Still owed by this phase**, and the allowlist in
`test_every_payload_file_is_owned_by_a_package` is the list: `.install-manifest`
(generated), `config/moonraker-custom.conf` (user state, and arguably
`conffiles` once the on-printer half lands), and opkg's own `var`, `var/lib`,
`var/run`. Five entries, three of them opkg's. `anvil.conf` was a sixth until
it was removed outright -- the test says so where the entry used to be, so it
cannot come back under an exemption.

## Phase 3 — a feed over the network  *(the printer's half: done)*

`bin/build-packages.sh` writes `anvil.adb` with `apk mkndx`, and **signs both
it and every package** when `APK_SIGN_KEY` is set. What was missing was the
other two thirds: a URL the printer asks, and a tree at that URL.

**The printer now ships knowing where to look.** `bin/common.sh` holds

    FEED_URL="${FEED_URL:-http://reforge.8941973.xyz/apk}"

and `pkgs/anvil-core` generates `$MODDIR/etc/apk/repositories` from it, beside
the public key it already shipped. `bin/publish-feed.sh` writes the matching
tree — `<arch>/anvil.adb` and the packages beside it — and the release workflow
attaches it as `reforge-apk-feed.tar.gz`, so a host can be filled from any
release, including ones tagged before the host existed.

**THE POINTER HAD TO SHIP FIRST, and that is why this landed with no host
running.** A feed cannot tell a printer where the feed is. Every machine
installed without that file needs a USB stick before it can ever fetch
anything, so the file has to travel in the `.tgz` — which means shipping a URL
that 404s for as long as it takes to stand the host up. The cost of doing so
is bounded, and read out of apk's source rather than assumed: an unreachable
repository fails `apk upgrade` and nothing else -- `apk_db_repository_check`
is called from `app_upgrade.c` and not from `app_add.c`. `apk add ./file.apk` does not consult a
repository at all.

**The entry names the index file rather than a directory**, which is the same
shape the USB stick uses and is a grammar rather than a preference:
`src/repoparser.c` reads a line ending `.adb` or `.tar.gz` as an index in
place — packages as its siblings, named by the `pkgname-spec` `mkndx` wrote
into the index — and anything else as a directory to look for
`<url>/<arch>/APKINDEX.tar.gz` under. The v3 directory form would work too, but
only with `mkndx --pkgname-spec '${arch}/${name}-${version}.apk'`; one layout,
exercised by every payload build, is worth more than the convention.

**The architecture is a directory in the URL and not a suffix on the file.**
Package file names carry no architecture, so two architectures served from one
directory would be two files with one name.

**The replica stopped writing that file.** `case-build-payload.sh` used to
write its own `etc/apk/repositories` naming `/mnt` and delete it before
tarring; it now passes `--repositories-file` with a path on the stick, which
`apk` reads *instead of* the default (`database.c`: the default file and the
`repositories.d` directories are consulted only when no file is named). So
what ships is whatever `anvil-core` installed, and the build never reads it.

**The one open piece is still certificates.** libfetch defaults to
`SSL_VERIFY_PEER` and falls back to `SSL_CTX_set_default_verify_paths()`, which
resolves to `$MODDIR/ssl` — empty. That is the same gap `tools/python/README.md`
records for CPython, and the same ~200KB `ca-certificates` bundle closes both.
Until one ships, the feed is `http://` and is not much weaker than it sounds:
every package is signed, and a signature is what actually decides whether a
printer installs it.

**What is left after that is operational, not code:** a host answering at
`$FEED_URL`, and a decision about who runs `bin/publish-feed.sh` — a release
step with a deploy secret, or a person with the release tarball.

## What this does not fix, and is not meant to

* **It does not shrink the build.** Every package is still cross-compiled here,
  from a pinned and hashed source. That was never going to change; see the fact
  that decides the comparison.
* **It does not replace `versions.env`.** Pins and hashes stay exactly where
  they are; `pkg.conf` reads them rather than restating them.
* **It does not make the printer able to install other people's packages.** The
  architecture string is chosen specifically to make that fail loudly.
