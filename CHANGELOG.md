# Changelog

All notable Reforge changes are recorded here. The project is in beta: a
feature can be implemented and replica-tested without yet being validated on
both printer models or through every real-world workflow.

## Unreleased

Release preparation and documentation sweep.

### Added

- The installer refuses to install on a printer running FlashForge firmware
  older than 1.9.6, and says to install FlashForge's current firmware first.
  On those releases the board firmware and Klipper do not agree, the MCU never
  connects, and the printer comes up with no Klipper and no screen — which
  looks like a bad flash rather than a mismatch. Nothing is written to the
  printer when the gate refuses: it puts the reason on the panel, leaves
  `anvil-NOT-INSTALLED.txt` on the USB stick, and the printer boots as it did
  before. A version it cannot read is installed on, as before.

## v20260827c-melitopol — 2026-08-27

### Added

- HelixScreen’s Filament page now follows the selected tool for material,
  spool, temperatures, loading, and retracting.
- Installed packages record the Reforge APK feed location for future updates.

### Fixed

- A selected tool with no resolvable heater is logged and ignored instead of
  heating the wrong hotend.

## v20260827d-melitopol — 2026-08-27

### Added

- HelixScreen pressure-advance calibration integration and per-tool Z
  correction selection in the tune overlay.

### Fixed

- Pressure-advance calibration restores the previous heater target, including
  when a sweep fails partway through.
- Calibration documentation now explains that results belong in the slicer’s
  filament profile rather than being saved to `printer.cfg`.

## v20260827-melitopol — 2026-08-27

### Added

- s6-rc supervision for the web stack, camera, Moonraker, Wi-Fi, and related
  services, with readiness checks based on actual service readiness.
- A printer-local CPython 3.13 runtime for Moonraker with working SQLite.
- CPU priority controls that let Moonraker and the camera yield to Klipper.
- HelixScreen settings persistence across firmware updates.

### Changed

- Reforge owns and starts the camera and web stack rather than stock
  `firmwareExe`.
- Startup retries until MCU boards answer and shows boot progress.

## v20260825b-nova-kakhovka — 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- `TOOL_OFFSET_CALIBRATE` no longer shuts Klipper down on completion.

## v20260825-nova-kakhovka — 2026-08-25

### Added

- First-boot import of factory per-unit calibration into Klipper config.
- Toolchanger-aware calibration, status commands, and safe plate checks.
- An update path that preserves the root password and user configuration.

### Fixed

- Release builds can no longer silently fall back to the stock Klipper tree.

## v20260824-nova-kakhovka — 2026-08-24

### Added

- USB packages for Creator 5 and Creator 5 Pro with model guards.
- Current Klipper with Creator 5 toolchanger support, Mainsail, Moonraker,
  HelixScreen, camera streaming, Wi-Fi, and root SSH.
- Stock slicer compatibility through `[ff_print]`, `START_PRINT`, and
  `END_PRINT`, including preparation, mesh loading, nozzle cleaning, tool
  checks, and safe cancellation.
- Tool-aware filament load, unload, purge, runout, and clog handling.
- Automatic pressure-advance calibration and VFA calibration support.
- Timelapse support, signed APK packages, pinned inputs, and Docker plus
  printer-replica QA.

### Known release issue

The original packages were withdrawn because they could install a mixed
Klipper tree. Use the rebuilt release or a later release; see its release note.

## Project start — 2026-08-20

- Initial reverse-engineering notes and USB-installable firmware builder.
