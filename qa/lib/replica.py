"""The replica, as a fixture rather than as a test runner.

WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY IT IS THE WHOLE POINT

tools/replica/ffsim/replica.py runs one container per case script:

    docker run --rm --privileged ... <image> /case.sh

entrypoint.sh sets the machine up, chroots in, runs the case, and the
container exits. The case's exit code is the entire result. That is why
6,280 lines of case-*.sh report 13 bits between them, and why a failure in
case-moonraker.sh -- 1,059 lines -- tells you only that something in there
went wrong.

Here the container is started ONCE per test module and held open, and each
test reaches into it with `docker exec`. Nothing about the machine changes:
the same image, the same --privileged, the same entrypoint.sh, assemble.sh,
binfmt.sh and seed-prog.sh, the same read-only squashfs root and writable
prog/data partitions, the same chroot onto the printer's own busybox under
qemu. What changes is that one container now yields as many individually
named, individually selectable results as you care to write.

HOW IT IS HELD OPEN

entrypoint.sh is reused UNMODIFIED -- it is setup, and setup is exactly where
shell belongs. It ends by running the case script inside the chroot, so the
case script it is given here is qa/replica/actions/hold.sh, which touches a
marker and then sleeps forever. Setup runs to completion exactly as it always
has, and then the container simply does not exit.

That marker is also the readiness signal, and it has to be: setup is fast
now that the image carries the installed baseline, but "fast" is a property
of one machine's disk and one image's contents. Polling for the marker waits
for however long this machine actually needs, rather than for a constant
somebody guessed.

ISOLATION

One container per module, which is the same boundary the case scripts have
today -- each of them starts from a fresh machine, and none of them shares
state with another. Tests within a module share, deliberately: they are the
assertions that used to live in one case script, and they were always
sequential steps against one machine.

For the rare test that needs to undo what it did, snapshot()/restore() tar
the writable partitions. It is not the default because it costs a second or
two per call and most tests do not need it.
