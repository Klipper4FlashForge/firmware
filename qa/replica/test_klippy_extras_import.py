"""Every klippy extra the shipped config names, imported on the interpreter that will import it.

THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR

klippy moved from FlashForge's CPython 3.8.2 to our own 3.13, and 3.8.2's
rootfs had numpy where ours did not. `extras/stepper_resonance_tester.py`
opens with a bare `import numpy as np`; `printer.base.cfg` includes
FlashForge's `printer.vibration.cfg`, which declares
`[stepper_resonance_tester]`; and `klippy.py:122` walks EVERY config section
through a `load_object` whose `importlib.import_module` is not wrapped in
`except ImportError`. So the result was not a printer missing resonance
testing. It was a klippy that never reached ready.

Two repo comments asserted the opposite -- that the module guarded its own
import and the printer simply carried on without it -- and both survived
review, because nothing anywhere asked the question this file asks. The
package list, the ipk contents and the ABI sweep all passed: the missing
dependency was not a broken file, it was a file that was never there.

WHY THE REPLICA AND NOT qa/static

The config that broke us is FlashForge's. `printer.vibration.cfg` is not in
this repo and never will be -- it arrives on the printer from the stock
firmware, and `printer.base.cfg:19` merely includes it. A static test could
only check the includes we ship, which are exactly the ones that were never
the problem. The real config graph exists on a real machine, so the question
gets asked there.

WHY IT NEEDS NO MCU

Importing is what fails here, and importing happens in `_read_config`, which
klippy runs BEFORE `klippy:mcu_identify`. The replica has no /dev/ttyS4,5,7
and klippy can never reach ready on it (see test_s6rc.py) -- but it does not
need to. This walks the same graph klippy walks and imports the same modules
klippy imports, one step ahead of the hardware it does not have.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT ASSERTED

That a section maps to an extra AT ALL. Most do not: `[stepper_x]`,
`[printer]`, `[board_pins]` and every `[gcode_macro ...]` have no file under
extras/, and `load_object` returns None for them rather than failing. This
mirrors that -- a section with no module is skipped, exactly as klippy skips
it. What is asserted is the other half: where a module DOES exist, it must
import, because klippy has no path that tolerates one that does not.
