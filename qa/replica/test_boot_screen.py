"""The boot screen, drawn by the printer's own interpreter.

A port of the retired test/integration/printer/case-boot-screen.sh.

WHAT THIS ADDS OVER test/integration/test_ffscreen.py. That file is the
host-side unit coverage -- pixel formats, buffer bounds, rotation arithmetic,
degradation to "no screen" -- and it runs ffscreen.py on the DEVELOPER's
CPython. None of it can say whether the file executes on the machine it ships
to. What only a replica can answer:

  * whether $MODDIR/bin/python3.13 -- our own cross-built CPython 3.13,
    running here under qemu-mipsel -- executes this code at all. ffscreen.py
    is stdlib-only and that has been reasoned about; reasoning has not been
    enough before, so the interpreter runs it.
  * whether anvil-env.sh, the file every real caller sources, actually
    resolves FF_PYTHON to that interpreter.
  * whether ff-startup.py finds its two siblings when run BY PATH, which is
    the only way its plain-name imports resolve. A silently missing
    ff_mcu_bringup means the boards are never handed over and klippy opens
    ports at bootloaders; a silently missing ffscreen means a black panel
    forever. Both imports are optional by design, so neither failure is loud.
  * whether the bytes land where the arithmetic says, on this kernel and this
    interpreter. A stride or bpp error produces a sheared panel, not an
    exception, so the check has to be on the buffer itself.

WHAT IS REAL HERE AND WHAT IS NOT

NO PANEL IS INVOLVED. There is no framebuffer driver, no display and no
kernel fb device in the replica: assemble.sh:103 creates /dev/fb0 as an empty
REGULAR FILE (`: > $R/dev/fb0`, so that the stock installer's
`cat start.img > /dev/fb0` works). That is exactly what a framebuffer is from
a writer's point of view -- open, seekless write of one screen's worth of
bytes -- so the code path under test is the real one, but "it drew" here
means "it wrote the right bytes to a file", never "a picture appeared".
test_the_replica_has_only_a_stand_in_framebuffer asserts that stand-in rather
than leaving it as an assumption, because a test that passes when nothing was
drawn is worse than no test.

GEOMETRY IS PASSED EXPLICITLY, for the same reason the case script passed it:
assemble.sh mounts the host's /sys read-only, so a sysfs probe in here would
describe the developer's monitor. The numbers are the machine's real ones --
a PORTRAIT 480x800 framebuffer at 32bpp shown on a landscape 800x480 panel
turned 90 degrees clockwise -- established from FlashForge's own
/usr/prog/start.img, which is 1536000 bytes and only decodes into a picture
when read that way.

WHAT WAS DROPPED FROM THE CASE SCRIPT

  * its whole staging preamble -- unpacking /mnt/py.tgz into $MODDIR and
    `cp /tmp/payload/bin/*.py` -- and with it gates.py's boot_screen() Skip
    when nothing had built an interpreter. The `printer` fixture installs the
    real package through the printer's own app_startup.sh, so the
    interpreter and the three scripts are there because the INSTALLER put
    them there. test_the_installer_placed_the_boot_screen_scripts asserts
    that, which is strictly more than the case script could ask: it hand-fed
    itself the files it then checked for.
  * `ok`/`bad` and the FAIL counter. Each of them is a test below.

Not in scope: tools/replica/printer/case-boot-screen-dump.sh, which renders
frames as base64 PNGs for a human to look at under `make boot-screen-sim`. It
is a viewer, not a test.
