"""Does an update replace the whole of $MODDIR, and keep the little that must live?

Two synthetic payloads are built on the printer, the REAL
installer/runFirmwareExe.sh is run over them by the printer's own busybox, and
every question below is put to the filesystem afterwards. Nothing here greps
the installer -- a grep would pass on an installer that deletes nothing and
fail on a variable rename, and neither answer is about the printer.

WHY IT MATTERS. `rm -rf $MODDIR` before extracting makes the installed set the
shipped set by construction: a renamed script cannot survive beside the one
that replaced it, and no list has to be shipped, read or trusted for that to
hold. What it costs is everything else under $MODDIR, so the pair of claims
this module holds is "the whole tree goes" and "the two things that outlive it
did". Either alone is trivially satisfiable -- delete everything, or delete
nothing -- and only both at once mean anything.

The survivor is HelixScreen's settings, held on /tmp across the wipe and copied
back over the tarball's seeded defaults. It is now the ONLY preservation
mechanism in the installer, so it is asserted here with a value that could only
have come from the printer. /usr/data/config is the other half of the answer,
and it is outside $MODDIR entirely: printer.cfg and moonraker-custom.conf are
never candidates for deletion because the wipe cannot reach them.

THE NEGATIVE CONTROL IS INVERTED from what it used to be. `bin/not-ours` is a
file no payload ever shipped, sitting in $MODDIR/bin beside one that has to go,
and it must NOT survive: $MODDIR is the mod's install tree and an owner's own
files belong in /usr/data. See docs/notes/86-wipe-and-extract.md for the audit
behind that trade.

THE FIXTURE FILENAMES ARE ARBITRARY. `bin/helper-v1`, `share/web-launcher`,
`share/nginx-launcher`, `oldskin/` and friends stand for "a path the last
package shipped"; nothing about them is real and no shipped file has those
names.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES TO THE MACHINE. The `printer` fixture is a replica with
the real package installed, and the first thing here is `rm -rf $MODDIR`: what
is under test is runFirmwareExe.sh, whose entire input is a tarball plus
whatever the last install left on disk, and a hand-built payload exercises that
exactly as well as a 100MB one while leaving the assertions legible. The
container is module-scoped and nothing else shares it, so the wipe costs
nothing -- but it is the reason this lives in its own file. Tests are
sequential steps against one machine, in file order.
