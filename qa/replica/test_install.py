"""What the machine's own installer produced, asked of the machine it produced.

The port of `case-install.sh` (579 lines, one bit) -- the gate that decides
whether a package bricks a printer.

WHY THIS MODULE LOOKS SO DIFFERENT FROM THE CASE SCRIPT. Most of that file was
DRIVING the install: attach the stick, run app_startup.sh, wait for it to
settle, do it twice more. None of that is here, because the `printer` fixture
already IS the result -- the package installed by `/usr/prog/app_startup.sh`,
verbatim, off a genuine FAT filesystem on `/dev/sda1`, exactly as a user
installs it from a USB stick (see qa/replica/conftest.py). What is left is the
part that was always the point: the assertions.

That is also why nothing here replays the install by hand. The case script's
own header records that lesson being learned once already:

    An earlier version of this file replayed app_startup.sh by hand -- which
    meant a bug in our reading of it could never be caught.

THREE OF THE CASE'S ASSERTIONS WERE STALE AND ARE NOT REPRODUCED. They are why
the gate was red, and each is replaced by the question that means the same
thing today:

  * `grep helix firmwareExe` -- the wrapper used to exec HelixScreen itself.
    It does not: it starts s6 and the UI is the `ui` service. Replaced by
    test_the_wrapper_starts_the_supervisor and
    test_the_ui_is_a_service_in_the_compiled_database.
  * `[ -d $MODDIR/init.d ]`, else "no service dir exists to start Klipper" --
    there is no init.d. Replaced by test_klipper_is_a_service_in_the_database.
  * grepping the boot log for `S60nginx S62moonraker S70klipper S80ui`.
    NOT replaced by grepping it for the new names. That log line reads
    `s6-rc: bringing up: camera klipper moonraker nginx ui ff-startup wifi`
    and names every service in the boot set INCLUDING THE ONES THAT THEN FAIL,
    so grepping it would pass on a machine where klipper never started -- a
    green assertion that cannot go red. The database is asked instead, which
    is a fact about what was installed rather than an intention.

WHAT A REPLICA CANNOT ANSWER, so it is not asked here:

  * boot 2, the re-install: the bake deletes `/stick.img` once the install has
    landed, so there is no stick to install from a second time. The property
    that matters -- an update keeps what the user edited and drops only what
    the last package shipped -- is asserted directly in test_upgrade.py, which
    drives runFirmwareExe.sh over two payloads.
  * boot 3's UI liveness: `ok-all` is unreachable on a replica (no
    /dev/ttyS4,5,7, no /dev/video*), so "the UI is running and the stock
    watchdog is satisfied" cannot be asked. The static half of it -- that the
    wrapper holds the foreground and keeps its name -- is in test_s6rc.py.
