"""A `[ -f $MODDIR/... ]` guard that can only ever be false.

THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR. `installer/runFirmwareExe.sh` used to replace
FlashForge's `klipperDaemon`, and it guarded that work with

    if [ -f $MODDIR/bin/klipperDaemon ] && [ -d /usr/prog/klipper ]; then

while the file shipped at `$MODDIR/prog/klipperDaemon` -- it had moved in
057a3a1 and the guard had not. The test was false on every printer and the
whole block was skipped IN SILENCE: no error, no log line, for release after
release. That block is gone; the class of bug it is named for is what this
file gates.

Nothing could have caught it. `sh -n` parses it, shellcheck likes it, and both
lanes stay green because the branch simply never runs. `test_no_undefined_names`
is the same idea for Python; this is the shell half.

WHY EXISTENCE GUARDS AND NOT EVERY $MODDIR PATH. Most `$MODDIR/...` references
are things a script CREATES or writes, and demanding those exist in a package
would be wrong. A `[ -f ]` / `[ -x ]` / `[ -d ]` is different: it is a claim
that something is already there, and the only two ways it can be true are that
a package ships it or that an earlier step wrote it. The second is the
allowlist below, and it is deliberately short so that adding to it is a
decision somebody makes rather than a way to silence this test.
