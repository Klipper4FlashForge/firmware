"""Every script parses, and none of them is secretly bash.

Ported from test/run-tests.py's check_shell_syntax and check_no_bashisms. The
logic is theirs; what changes is the granularity. There, one gate covered ~25
files and reported one bit, so a syntax error in S62moonraker and a syntax
error in payload.sh were the same red line. Here each file is its own test, named
after itself, and `pytest -k S62moonraker` runs exactly one.

The original's docstring made a deliberate choice worth preserving:

    One line per check, not one per file: 25 green lines saying "syntax ok"
    hide the two that matter.

That reasoning was about output noise, and it was right. pytest solves it a
different way -- passes collapse to dots, and only failures print -- so the
granularity and the quiet are no longer in tension.

WHY THE PAYLOAD IS CHECKED TWICE, WITH DIFFERENT DIALECTS

`bash -n` proves a file parses at all. shellcheck's dash dialect proves it uses
nothing bash-only, which is what matters for anything a recipe ships: the
printer runs busybox ash, not bash, and a bash-only construct parses perfectly
here and fails there. dash rather than sh as the dialect because busybox ash,
like dash, supports `local`, which the payload uses.

# THE PRINTER'S SCRIPTS ARE ADDRESSED BY THE SHAPE OF A RECIPE, not by a
# top-level directory: pkgs/<recipe>/payload/ is what that recipe installs
# under $MODDIR. Neither level is named recipe by recipe here, so a new recipe
# with scripts in it is covered the day it lands.
#
# The s6-rc `run` scripts are in the list because s6-supervise execs them
# under the printer's ash, and a bashism in one is a service that never starts
# and says so only in s6's own log.

#
# installer/ matters more than it used to: runFirmwareExe.sh IS the
