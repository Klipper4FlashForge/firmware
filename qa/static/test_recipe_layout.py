"""The two facts about recipe layout that have a consequence.

A recipe directory has a fixed shape -- build.sh and pkg.conf beside
payload/, seed/ and control/ -- and recipes live at two depths, pkgs/<name>/
for the ones carrying files of this repo and pkgs/3rdparty/<name>/ for the ones
building a pinned tarball. That shape is documented in docs/building.md and in
pkgs/lib.sh, which is the only code that depends on it.

MOST OF IT IS NOT ASSERTED HERE, and that is deliberate. This file used to hold
seven more tests: that a recipe contains no fourth kind of directory, that each
kind is still used by someone, that a 3rdparty recipe carries no files of ours
and a first-party one carries some, that installer/ holds exactly two named
files. Every one of them compared the tree against a description of the tree.
None could go red for a reason a printer would notice -- a stray file in a
recipe directory is not read by anything, and a recipe filed at the wrong depth
still builds the same package -- while all seven went red the moment the layout
legitimately changed, which is the opposite of what a test is for.

What is left is the two that bite:
