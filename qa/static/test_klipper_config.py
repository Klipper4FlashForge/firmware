"""The Klipper config we ship: one pin, one owner, and macros that compile.

THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR. `chamber_heat_fan` had to change section type per
model -- `[heater_fan]` on the Pro so the element's fan follows the chamber
heater without any G-code running, `[fan_generic]` on the plain Creator 5,
which has no `chamber_heater` for `lookup_heater()` to resolve at
`klippy:ready`. Klipper can override an option but cannot un-declare a section,
so the section had to MOVE out of `printer.base.cfg` into the per-model
`chamber/<model>.cfg`.

That move is the dangerous kind. Leave the old section behind and PD12 is
claimed twice; `pins.py` raises "pin PD12 used multiple times in config" and
klippy refuses to start -- on a printer, after a flash, with no UI to say why.
Nothing else in the suite reads these files: `test_ipk.py` checks that the
chamber configs are PACKAGED, never that they PARSE.

WHY THIS LANE, AND WHAT IT THEREFORE CANNOT SEE. The static lane runs on a bare
checkout, so the only configs here are the ones this repo ships. FlashForge's
own includes -- printer.filament.cfg, printer.probe.cfg, printer.mesh.cfg,
printer.vibration.cfg -- exist only under work/ after `bin/unpack.sh`, and
conftest is explicit that a missing firmware image is a failure rather than a
skip, so depending on them here would make this lane fail on a clean clone.
They are skipped, and a pin they claim that one of ours also claims is NOT
caught here. That is a real hole; what closes it is that every pin-bearing
section on the main MCU lives in printer.base.cfg, which is ours.

WHY RawConfigParser(strict=False). Klipper's own parser. Same-named sections
MERGE and the last value wins, which is the mechanism ff-chamber.cfg uses to
override `initial_WHITE` on `[led chamber_led]`; a strict parser would call
that a duplicate-section error and this test would be wrong about the file the
printer actually reads.
