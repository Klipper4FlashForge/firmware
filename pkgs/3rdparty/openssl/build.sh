# OpenSSL -- the one project here whose configure is not an autoconf configure.
#
# THREE TRAPS, ALL HIT FOR REAL:
#
#  * `no-docs` only exists from 3.1. On 3.0.x it is an "Unsupported options"
#    HARD ERROR, so it is not passed here.
#  * the linux-mips32 target hardcodes -mips2 into its cflags, and this
#    toolchain defaults to -mfp64, which gcc refuses below mips32r2. User
#    cflags land AFTER the target's, so -mips32r2 puts the ISA back. If a
#    future OpenSSL orders them the other way, linux-generic32 (portable C) is
#    the fallback, TAKEN AUTOMATICALLY rather than left as a note, because the
#    failure is a wall of assembler errors that says nothing about ISA levels.
#  * --openssldir is where the interpreter looks for CA certificates on the
#    printer. See pkg.conf.
#
# THE FALLBACK IS WHY pkg_build RETURNS RATHER THAN DIES: here there is
# something to try next, and `if ! pkg_build` is how that is said. OpenSSL
# gets no verb of its own -- it sets three of pkg_build's knobs.
