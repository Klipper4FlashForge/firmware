# WHAT A RECIPE LOOKS LIKE WHEN THERE IS NOTHING TO COMPILE. No
# pkg_toolchain, because no compiler is involved; no pkg_deps, because there
# is nothing to build against. Three lines do the work: name the source,
# put it where it goes, say what ships.
#
# THE ZIP HAS NO TOP-LEVEL DIRECTORY. Mainsail publishes index.html, assets/
# and the rest at the root of the archive, so $PKG_WORK/src IS the web root
# after unpacking and gets copied wholesale to www/mainsail. This was checked
# against the pinned artefact rather than assumed -- an archive that grew a
# wrapper directory would put the UI at www/mainsail/mainsail-2.18.2/ and
# serve a 404 from a build that looked clean, so the assertion below is the
# thing standing between that and a printer.
