# sqlite -- cross-compiled for the printer, as a build dependency of CPython.
#
# THE REASON THE INTERPRETER EXISTS. FlashForge built python 3.8.2 without _sqlite3 and shipped no libsqlite3 anywhere on the image, so every Moonraker from v0.9.0 on -- the release that moved the database from lmdb to sqlite -- dies at startup with ModuleNotFoundError. This library is what closes that.
#
# NOTHING INSTALLS THIS ON A PRINTER. It is a static library: it ends up inside
# the interpreter, and there is no .so to ship or to find. The package exists
# so that CPython builds against something with a version and a checksum
# instead of against a directory somebody filled in earlier.
