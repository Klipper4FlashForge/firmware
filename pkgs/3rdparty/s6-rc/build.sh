# s6-rc -- the service manager, cross-compiled against the packaged skalibs,
# execline and s6.
#
# --bootdb AND --livedir ARE BAKED IN, like every other prefix in this stack.
# --bootdb is where s6-rc-init looks for the compiled database; its default
# happens to be where we want it, and is spelled out here because a default
# that happens to be right is not the same as a decision. --livedir stays at
# /run/s6-rc: it must be on a tmpfs that is empty at boot, because s6-rc-init
# refuses to run over a live directory that already exists. Whether /run is
# tmpfs on this printer is the one thing here not checked on hardware.
#
# WHAT SHIPS is the runtime plus the two tools a printer needs to change its
# own database, which it now does: anvil-core's postinst compiles a new one on
# every upgrade of the service definitions.
#
# s6-rc-update is what makes that safe. s6-rc-init records the live state as
# one byte per service in the database it booted, and /run/s6-rc/compiled is a
# symlink to compiled/current -- so moving `current` under a running system
# leaves a state file whose size no longer matches, and every `s6-rc` command
# fails with "unable to read valid state" until the next boot. s6-rc-update
# reconciles the live state with the new database instead, leaving unchanged
# services alone. Measured on a printer, 2026-08-31.
