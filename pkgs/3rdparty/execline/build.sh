# --enable-absolute-paths IS THE ONE FLAG WORTH EXPLAINING. Without it
# execline's EXTBINPREFIX is empty, so a generated script saying `fdmove`
# resolves it through PATH -- and a supervisor whose scripts depend on an
# inherited environment fails with "unable to exec fdmove", a message that
# names a program rather than the environment that was actually wrong. With
# the flag, generated scripts carry $MODDIR/bin/fdmove and depend on nothing.
#
# --with-sysdeps, --with-include and --with-lib all point INTO THE SYSROOT
# pkg_deps filled. One of each is enough even when a recipe depends on three
# packages, because pkg_deps merges them all under one $MODDIR inside the
# sysroot -- the layout they will have on the printer.
