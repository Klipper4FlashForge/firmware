# skalibs -- cross-compiled for the printer, as a package.
#
# THE FOUR --with-sysdep-* ANSWERS ARE THE POINT OF THIS FILE. skalibs settles
# these by COMPILING AND RUNNING a probe, which a cross-build cannot do, and
# left unanswered configure stops. The answers are the printer's:
# /dev/urandom exists, posix_spawn does not return early, /proc/self/exe is
# readable, and select() accepts an infinite timeout.
#
# THEY ARE ANSWERS ABOUT THE LIBC, WHICH IS WHY THIS IS A PACKAGE: change the
# toolchain and they have to be re-settled rather than reused. As a package it
# has a stamp containing the toolchain, so a toolchain change rebuilds it. A
# private sysroot inside the s6 recipe would have been reused, because nothing
# about it had a version, and that failure shipped once.
#
# The static/dynamic decision is not made here -- skalibs has no option for it
# -- but by the consumers, which link libc dynamically against the printer's.
