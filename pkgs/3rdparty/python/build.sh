# THE SEVEN LIBRARIES ARE STATIC AND NONE OF THEM SHIPS WITH THIS PACKAGE.
# They arrive as -dev packages and link into the interpreter and its extension
# modules, so the printer has no .so of ours to find at runtime: no
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH to get right and no chance of picking up one of
# FlashForge's /usr/prog copies (/usr/prog carries libffi.so.8 while the
# rootfs carries .so.7). The cost is a few MB of duplicated libcrypto.

# Both of these are why the gates at the bottom of this file exist:
#   -latomic  64-bit atomics on mips32 are out-of-line calls into libatomic,
#             which CPython 3.13's _Py_atomic_* on 64-bit types needs.
#             libatomic.so.1 is on the rootfs, so this is a runtime
#             dependency, not a static link.
#   -lm       because libsqlite3 here is STATIC, and a .a carries no DT_NEEDED
#             on libm. configure's sqlite3 probe then fails on undefined
#             floor/log/pow, and CPython records _sqlite3 as missing and
#             carries on -- a probe failure, so nothing says why it is absent.

# --without-ensurepip: pip needs a network and a compiler, and a printer has
#   neither. The build-python has the opposite answer; see pkg_buildpython.
# --disable-test-modules: a third of the tree, none of which runs here.

# ONE BINARY OUT OF bin/, BY NAME. `make install` also leaves python3, idle3,
# pydoc3 and the *-config scripts there, and naming what ships is what keeps
# bin/python3 -- which would shadow FlashForge's interpreter on the PATH
# anvil-env.sh exports -- off a printer. Naming rather than removing means a
# future CPython that installs one more launcher is excluded by default.
#
# site-packages rides along inside lib/python3.13/ and needs no line of its
# own: `make install` creates it empty and this package owns it.
