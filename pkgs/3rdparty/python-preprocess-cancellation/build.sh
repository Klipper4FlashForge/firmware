# COPIED, NOT BUILT. This sdist declares no [build-system] and ships no
# setup.py, so there is no backend to call -- pip's legacy fallback would
# auto-discover a flat layout and emit a wheel named UNKNOWN-0.0.0 containing
# the one module, which is the right file arrived at by an accident a future
# setuptools is free to change. The package IS one module, so the honest
# operation is a copy. (The same release also declares version 0.0.0 in its own
# metadata, so a version specifier would be refused by pip even if there were
# something to build.)
