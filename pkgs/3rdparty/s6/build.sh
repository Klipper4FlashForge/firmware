# s6 -- the supervisor, cross-compiled against the packaged skalibs and
# execline and linked dynamically against the printer's own glibc.
#
# WHAT SHIPS IS A SUBSET of the ~40 binaries s6 installs. Thirteen are the
# supervision machinery: the scanner and its control channel, one supervisor
# per service and the verb that talks to it, "is it up", the readiness wait,
# the listening verbs those exec, and the fifodir tools they need.
#
# Eight more are here because s6-rc's GENERATED scripts exec them, which s6's
# own documentation does not say -- found by running a real s6-rc up/down
# cycle with a PATH containing only the candidates. s6rc-oneshot-runner needs
# the ipcserver chain and s6-sudod; s6-rc execs s6-sudo, which execs
# s6-sudoc; the fdholder servicedir, which s6-rc-compile writes into EVERY
# database, needs s6-fdholder-daemon and s6-ipcclient. Leaving any out gives
# "s6-rc: warning: unable to spawn subprocess" at boot.
#
# Execline is deliberately left enabled: s6-rc has no flag to disable it.
