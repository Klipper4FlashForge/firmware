"""Hand the toolhead boards over from their bootloader to their application.

Three of the four boards Klipper talks to answer only after a handshake: the
board's bootloader sends "Ready", the host replies 'A', the board acks and
jumps to its application. On stock firmware, firmwareExe carried that routine
three times over -- bootSerialHeatMcu, bootSerialMainEboardMcu and
bootSerialLevelBoardMcu, byte-identical apart from a hard-coded device path.

Replacing firmwareExe took all three away, and /usr/prog/klipper/start.sh
covered only two of the four boards:

    /dev/ttyS2  mcu           cmd_mcu bootup, in start.sh      still stock
    /dev/ttyS5  eboard        checkEboard                      NOW HERE
    /dev/ttyS4  eheaterboard  NOBODY   <- klippy cannot connect
    /dev/ttyS7  levelboard    NOBODY

so this covers the two that were left out, and since it does the job better
than checkEboard did, the eboard as well. It has to run before klippy opens
the ports.

WHY checkEboard IS GONE. It is 9KB containing one function --
_Z23bootSerialMainEboardMcuv, an older -O2 build of the same routine, hard
wired to /dev/ttyS5 -- and its only imports are the tty calls and printf. It
flashes nothing and touches no other device, so nothing is lost by dropping
it. What is gained is the ttyS5 half of the ready phase: stock sets isReady on
ANY byte from that port, so checkEboard cheerfully sends 'A' at an eboard that
is already running Klipper and merely returning garbage at the wrong baud.
Here only a banner earns a write. Doing all three ports in one pass is also
strictly better than doing ttyS5 afterwards, for the reason in the first
bullet below: a port nobody holds open is shut down in the driver, so the
banners it sends while another port is being polled are lost.

Doing nothing is always a valid outcome: a board that already started its
application never sends the banner, and then we must not write to its port at
all -- it is speaking the Klipper protocol by that point. 'A' is therefore
only ever sent inside the branch that matched "Ready".

Three things the first version got wrong, all of them seen on a real printer:

  * It polled one port at a time. A serial port that nobody has open is shut
    down in the driver, so while ttyS4 was being polled every banner ttyS7
    sent was dropped on the floor -- which is why the two ports took turns
    reporting a banner across consecutive runs. Every port is opened up
    front now and they are polled together.

  * It bounded the wait by a read count, not by time. VTIME=1 makes a read
    return after 0.1s only when the board says nothing; a board that is
    saying anything at all returns reads instantly, so 50 reads could elapse
    in milliseconds and still be reported as a full wait.

  * "No banner" was reported as "already running". It is not the same thing:
    ttyS4 was declared already-running on one pass and then sent a bootloader
    banner on the next. The banner repeats on a period longer than the old 5s
    window, so a board can be sitting in its bootloader and simply be between
    banners. That verdict is reported now as what it is -- unknown.

The ack byte is logged but no longer required to be 0x06. That is not a
guess -- the three bootSerial* routines were disassembled out of the 1.9.7
firmwareExe, and stock sends 'A' fifty times and ignores everything the
board sends back except as a reason to stop early. See handshake() for the
decompiled loop. The level board answers 0x01 every time while the heat
board answers 0x06, and refusing the handshake over that byte is what left
the level board in its bootloader with klippy timing out on
identify_response.

What actually tells us whether a board left the bootloader is whether it
goes on repeating the banner, so that is what is checked: after 'A' is sent,
a board that stays quiet for QUIET_S has moved on, and one that banners
again gets another round of 'A'. Stock never checks that at all -- it
returns success on the strength of the ready phase alone.

          * a reply that is not 0x06 is *ignored*. It only means the loop

            cannot fail the handshake at all -- the return value depends
            only on isReady.

        board's 0x01 as a failure. Stock would have sent another forty-nine
