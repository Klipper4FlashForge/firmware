# Automatic pressure advance for the FlashForge Creator 5 Pro.
#
# A port of the sweep the touchscreen runs inside its pre-print nozzle clean,
# recovered from the firmwareExe binary (MIPS machine code):
#   CommMgr::paTestMgr                        @0x791640  (the whole procedure)
#   CalibrationDialog::testPaTest             @0x82d054  (an inlined 2nd copy)
#   CommMgr::resetTmcPa                       @0x79350c  (the exit block)
# Full walkthrough: docs/notes/51-pa-calibration-recovered.md
#
# Four things about this are not obvious from the code:
#
#   * THE MEASUREMENT IS NOT OURS. Each line is scored by the closed eBoard
#     MCU, which watches 16-bit samples arriving on its second UART from a
#     transducer we have not identified and answers one number. We ship that
#     firmware unchanged, so we get the same verdicts the touchscreen does.
#     [pa_adjust] is the 40-line forwarder that carries the two commands.
#
#   * THE CARRIAGE DOES NOT MOVE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. The prologue
#     latches enable_pin_tmc_x/y, which hard-disables the X and Y drivers, so
#     every `G1 X` in the sweep is planned by Klipper and executed by nobody.
#     The toolhead stays exactly where the prologue parked it and the ~1 g of
#     filament falls straight down from there. The app parks over the PURGE
#     CHUTE first -- clearNozzleEddy @0x78f030 builds the restore string from
#     X = 275 + tool_dx, Y = 254 + tool_dy, the same two constants
#     ff-filament.cfg carries as purge_x/purge_y -- so the extrudate goes down
#     the chute and never touches the plate. We now do the same.
#
#     The X/Y ladder is therefore a TIMING GENERATOR and nothing else. It
#     exists only to stretch each candidate over the two 10x flow steps where
#     pressure advance can show up. Nothing draws lines, nothing looks at
#     them, and the scrambled candidate order buys no spatial separation
#     because there is no space -- it is kept because it is the app's.
#
#   * SO SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION IS MANDATORY ON EXIT. After the sweep Klipper
#     believes the carriage walked to the end of the ladder while it never
#     left the chute. The app replays the parked coordinates (resetTmcPa
#     @0x79350c takes them as its argument) and so must we -- without it the
#     next move is planned from a position that is a lie, and it is homed
#     state that makes it dangerous rather than merely wrong.
#
#   * THE MISSING M400 IS DELIBERATE. pa_action is an immediate MCU command,
#     so ACTION=0 fires while motion is still queued; what bounds it is
#     Klipper throttling G-code input at BUFFER_TIME_HIGH (toolhead.py
#     _check_pause, 2.0 s) against a line that is ~4.94 s long. The eBoard is
#     not handed a tight window -- it is told "a line is coming" and "that was
#     the last one" and finds the event itself. The app hits the same
#     throttle. Do NOT add barriers inside a line to "fix" this; the scorer
#     was tuned against this timing.
#
#   * THIS REPORTS. It does not save the number, does not touch printer.cfg
#     and does not apply anything on a toolchange. The extruder's own
#     pressure advance is put back on exit -- which the app does not do,
#     because it immediately overrides it via SET_PA_ADVANCE and we do not.
#
# A Python extra rather than a macro because PA_GET only respond_info()s its
# value: a gcode_macro cannot read another command's output, and the sweep is
# a retry loop with a sort in it.
