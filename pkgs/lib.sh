# pkg_mesoncross -- write a meson cross file for this target and echo its path.

# setuptools package needs none of this.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS AT ALL: _PYTHON_SYSCONFIGDATA_NAME is a distutils/setuptools
# mechanism. Meson has never heard of it and will not cross-compile without
# being told, in this file, what the host machine is.
#
# THE COMPILERS ARE THE WRAPPERS, NOT THE TOOLCHAIN'S OWN. $PKG_XW/bin holds
# three-line shims that add $PKG_CC_FLAGS -- `-EL -mnan=2008` -- and the raw
# mips-linux-gnu-gcc beside them does not. A cross file naming the raw binary
# produces a tree that builds perfectly, passes every test that only reads
# symbols, and is refused at exec() on the printer, which is the failure
# pkg_toolchain's own e_flags gate exists to prevent. Reaching past the wrapper
# here would walk straight around that gate.
#
# python = $HOSTPY IS NOT A MISTAKE. Meson's python module introspects an
# interpreter by RUNNING it and asking sysconfig, and pkg_pytarget has already
# made $HOSTPY's sysconfig answer for mipsel. So the host interpreter reports
# the target's EXT_SUFFIX and INCLUDEPY, which is exactly what meson needs and
# what pkg_pytarget's closing gate has already proved before we get here.
#
# longdouble_format IS REQUIRED AND HAS NO DEFAULT. numpy determines it by
# compiling and RUNNING a probe, which a cross build cannot do; without this
# property the configure step dies with "Cannot determine long double format".
# o32 MIPS has a 64-bit long double -- the same representation as double --
# which is IEEE_DOUBLE_LE on a little-endian target.
