"""Build $MODDIR by installing the feed inside the printer replica.

    ./bin/build-payload.py <root-package> [<root-package> ...]

Writes the installed tree to $PAYLOAD_DIR, replacing whatever was there.

The printer's OWN apk installs onto the printer's own filesystem, under
qemu-mipsel, and the tree is tarred back out -- so maintainer scripts run
where they will run on a machine, and the install that ships is the install
that was tested.

WHAT IT COSTS. A privileged container and the printer image, which is why
`make build` has its own docker lane. The feed itself
(bin/build-packages.sh) still needs nothing but a checkout.
