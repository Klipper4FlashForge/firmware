#
# SLIM SHIPS NO FLASHFORGE COMPONENT AT ALL -- not the kernel, not the rootfs,
# not the MCU firmware, and since we own the installer, not the 26MB software
# component either. Two files do the work:
#
#     runFirmwareExe.sh   ours; app_startup.sh runs it, and it IS the install
#     anvil.tar.xz        the payload, everything under $MODDIR
#
# plus start.img, end.img and play, which are what the owner sees and hears
# while it runs. start.img is ours (installer/start.img); end.img and play
# still come from the stock package.
#
# Shipping no software component is what keeps app_startup.sh's own recovery
# working: /usr/prog/PROGRAM/software goes on holding FlashForge's version
# directory and their firmwareExe inside it, so the five-second watchdog there
# has a working UI to restore when an install goes wrong. Nothing in that
# component was ever ours to ship -- their klippy tree, their wifi module and
# their configs, going straight back to the partition they were already on.
#
# --full carries kernel/control/library verbatim, and the installer installs
# any component a package does carry: absent ones are skipped, exactly as
# FlashForge's own `ls -1t <name>-*.tar.xz` guard did.
